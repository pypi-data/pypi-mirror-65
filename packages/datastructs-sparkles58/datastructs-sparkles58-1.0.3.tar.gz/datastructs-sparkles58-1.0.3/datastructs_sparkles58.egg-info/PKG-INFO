Description: # Datastructs
        
        Datastructs is a small module containing trees and queues.
        
        ## Queues
        
        Queues are very simple. To create one, you can just use queue() with an iterable inside, or nothing to create an empty queue. They have two
        functions: enqueue(value), which inserts a given value to the beginning of the queue, and dequeue(), which removes the last element and
        returns it.
        
        ## Trees and nodes
        
        Trees and nodes are a bit more complicated. To create a tree, you can use tree(), with a value for the base node, or nothing to have the
        value be None. Nodes have a few functions. First there is set(value) which sets the value of the node, set_parent(node) which changes
        its parent node, add_child(value) which adds a child with that values to that nodes "children" list, and remove_child(node), which removes
        a child. The tree has an update() function, where you can optionally give it a new base node, and you never truly need to call it, as all
        of the node functions call it themselves. Nodes are indexed in a specific way in a tree's "nodes" list. It is a nested list, where each
        index of the list contains the nodes in that layer. Layer 0 is the base node, layer 1 is its children, and so on.
