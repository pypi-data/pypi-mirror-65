.. _System_Overview:

Overview
--------

A System is a `Composition <Composition>` that is a collection of `Processes <Process>` all of which are executed
together. Executing a System executes all of the `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` in its Processes in a structured order.
`Projections <Projection>` between Mechanisms in different Processes within the System are permitted, as are recurrent
Projections, but Projections from Mechanisms in other Systems are ignored (PsyNeuLink does not support ESP).  A System
can also be assigned a `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` as its `controller <System.controller>`, that can be
used to control parameters of other `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` (or their `functions <Mechanism_Base.function>` in the
System.

.. _System_Creation:

Creating a System
-----------------

Systems are created by instantiating the `System` class.  If no arguments are provided, a System with a single `Process`
containing a single `default_mechanism <Mechanism_Base.default_mechanism>` is created.  More commonly, a System is
created from one or more `Processes <Process>` that are specified in the **processes**  argument of the `System`
class, and listed in its `processes <System.processes>` attribute.

.. note::
   At present, only `Processes <Process>` can be assigned to a System; `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` cannot be assigned
   directly to a System.  They must be assigned to the `pathway <Process_Pathway>` of a Process, and then that Process
   must be included in the **processes** argument of the `System` class.

.. _System_Control_Specification:

*Specifying Control*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A controller can also be specified for the System, in the **controller** argument of the `System`.  This can be an
existing `ControlMechanism`, a constructor for one, or a class of ControlMechanism in which case a default
instance of that class will be created.  If an existing ControlMechanism or the constructor for one is used, then
the `OutputPorts it monitors <ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism>` and the `parameters it controls
<ControlMechanism_ControlSignals>` can be specified using its `objective_mechanism
<ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` and `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>`
attributes, respectively.  In addition, these can be specified in the **monitor_for_control** and **control_signal**
arguments of the `System`, as described below.

* **monitor_for_control** argument -- used to specify OutputPorts of Mechanisms in the System that should be
  monitored by the `ObjectiveMechanism` associated with the System's `controller <System.controller>` (see
  `ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism`);  these are used in addition to any specified for the ControlMechanism or
  its ObjectiveMechanism.  These can be specified in the **monitor_for_control** argument of the `System` using
  any of the ways used to specify the *monitored_output_ports* for an ObjectiveMechanism (see
  `ObjectiveMechanism_Monitor`).  In addition, the **monitor_for_control** argument supports two
  other forms of specification:

  * **string** -- must be the `name <OutputPort.name>` of an `OutputPort` of a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` in the System
    (see third example under `System_Control_Examples`).  This can be used anywhere a reference to an OutputPort can
    ordinarily be used (e.g., in an `InputPort tuple specification <InputPort_Tuple_Specification>`). Any OutputPort
    with a name matching the string will be monitored, including ones with the same name that belong to different
    Mechanisms within the System. If an OutputPort of a particular Mechanism is desired, and it shares its name with
    other Mechanisms in the System, then it must be referenced explicitly (see `InputPort specification
    <InputPort_Specification>`, and examples under `System_Control_Examples`).

  * **MonitoredOutputPortsOption** -- must be a value of `MonitoredOutputPortsOption`, and must appear alone or as a
    single item in the list specifying the **monitor_for_control** argument;  any other specification(s) included in
    the list will take precedence.  The MonitoredOutputPortsOption applies to all of the Mechanisms in the System
    except its `controller <System.controller>` and `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism>`. The
    *PRIMARY_OUTPUT_PORTS* value specifies that the `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` of every Mechanism be
    monitored, whereas *ALL_OUTPUT_PORTS* specifies that *every* OutputPort of every Mechanism be monitored.

  The default for the **monitor_for_control** argument is *MonitoredOutputPortsOption.PRIMARY_OUTPUT_PORTS*.
  The OutputPorts specified in the **monitor_for_control** argument are added to any already specified for the
  ControlMechanism's `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`, and the full set is listed in
  the ControlMechanism's `monitored_output_ports <EVCControlMechanism.monitored_output_ports>` attribute, and its
  ObjectiveMechanism's `monitored_output_ports <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_ports>` attribute).
..
* **control_signals** argument -- used to specify the parameters of Components in the System to be controlled. These
  can be specified in any of the ways used to `specify ControlSignals <ControlMechanism_ControlSignals>` in the
  *control_signals* argument of a ControlMechanism. These are added to any `ControlSignals <ControlSignal>` that have
  already been specified for the `controller <System.controller>` (listed in its `control_signals
  <ControlMechanism.control_signals>` attribute), and any parameters that have directly been `specified for
  control <ParameterPort_Specification>` within the System (see `System_Control` below for additional details).

.. _System_Structure:

Structure
---------

The Components of a System are shown in the figure below and summarized in the sections that follow.

.. _System_Full_Fig:

.. figure:: _static/System_full_fig.svg
   :alt: Overview of major PsyNeuLink components
   :scale: 75 %

   Two `Processes <Process>` are shown, both belonging to the same System.  Each Process has a
   series of :doc:`ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` linked by :doc:`MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`,
   that converge on a common final ProcessingMechanism.  Each ProcessingMechanism is labeled with its designation in
   the System.  The `TERMINAL` Mechanism for both Processes projects to an `ObjectiveMechanism` that is used to
   drive `learning <LearningProjection>` in Process B. It also projects to a separate ObjectiveMechanism that is used
   for control of ProcessingMechanisms in both Processes A and B.  Note that the Mechanisms and
   Projections responsible for learning and control belong to the System and can monitor and/or control Mechanisms
   belonging to more than one Process (as shown for control in this figure).


.. _System_Mechanisms:

*Mechanisms*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` in a System are assigned designations based on the position they occupy in the `graph
<System.graph>` and/or the role they play in a System:

    `ORIGIN`: receives input to the System (provided in the `execute <System.execute>` or `run
    <System.run> method), and does not receive a `Projection <Projection>` from any other `ProcessingMechanisms
    <ProcessingMechanism>`.

    `TERMINAL`: provides output from the System, and does not send Projections to any other ProcessingMechanisms.

    `SINGLETON`: both an `ORIGIN` and a `TERMINAL` Mechanism.

    `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`: sends a Projection that closes a recurrent loop; can be assigned an initial value.

    `CYCLE`: receives a Projection that closes a recurrent loop.

    `CONTROL`: monitors the value of another Mechanism for use in controlling parameter values.

    `LEARNING`: monitors the value of another Mechanism for use in learning.

    `TARGET`: ComparatorMechanism that monitors a `TERMINAL` Mechanism of a Process and compares it to a corresponding
    value provided in the `execute <System.execute>` or `run <System.run>` method.

    `INTERNAL`: ProcessingMechanism that does not fall into any of the categories above.

    .. note::
       Any `ORIGIN` and `TERMINAL` Mechanisms of a System must be, respectively, the `ORIGIN` or `TERMINAL` of any
       Process(es) to which they belong.  However, it is not necessarily the case that the `ORIGIN` and/or `TERMINAL`
       Mechanism of a Process is also the `ORIGIN` and/or `TERMINAL` of a System to which the Process belongs (see
       `example <LearningProjection_Output_vs_Terminal_Figure>`).

    .. note:: designations are stored in the `systems <Mechanism.systems>` attribute of a `Mechanism <Mechanism>`.

    COMMENT

.. _System_Graph:

*Graph*
~~~~~~~

When a System is created, a graph is constructed that describes the `Projections <Projection>` (edges) among its
`Mechanisms <Mechanism>` (nodes). The graph is assigned to the System's `graph <System.graph>` attribute.  A
System's `graph <System.graph>` can be displayed using its `System.show_graph` method.  The `graph
<System.graph>` is stored as a dictionary of dependencies that can be passed to graph theoretical tools for
analysis.  A System can have recurrent Processing pathways, such as feedback loops;  that is, the System's `graph
<System.graph> can be *cyclic*.  PsyNeuLink also uses the `graph <System.graph>` to determine the order in
which its Mechanisms are executed.  To do so in an orderly manner, however, the graph must be *acyclic*.  To address
this, PsyNeuLink constructs an `execution_graph <System.execution_graph>` from the System's `graph
<System.graph>`. If the  System is acyclic, these are the same. If the System is cyclic, then the `execution_graph
<System.execution_graph>` is a subset of the `graph <System.graph>` in which the dependencies (edges)
associated with Projections that close a loop have been removed. Note that this only impacts the order of execution;
the Projections themselves remain in effect, and will be fully functional during the execution of the Mechanisms
to and from which they project (see `System_Execution` below for a more detailed description).

.. _System_Scheduler:

*Scheduler*
~~~~~~~~~~~

Every System has two `Schedulers <Scheduler>`, one that handles the ordering of execution of its Components for
`processing <System_Execution_Processing>` (assigned to its `scheduler` attribute), and one that
does the same for `learning <System_Execution_Learning>` (assigned to its `scheduler_learning` attribute).
The `scheduler` can be assigned in the **scheduler** argument of the System's constructor;  if it is not
specified, a default `Scheduler` is created automatically.   The `scheduler_learning` is always assigned automatically.
The System's Schedulers base the ordering of execution of its Components based on the order in which they are listed
in the `pathway <Process.pathway>`\\s of the `Processes <Process>` used to construct the System, constrained by any
`Conditions <Condition>` that have been created for individual Components and assigned to the System's Schedulers (see
`Scheduler`, `Condition <Condition_Creation>`, `System_Execution_Processing`, and `System_Execution_Learning` for
additional details).  Both schedulers maintain a `Clock` that can be used to access their current `time
<Time_Overview>`.

.. _System_Control:

*Control*
~~~~~~~~~

A System can be assigned a `ControlMechanism` as its `controller <System.controller>`, that can be  used to
control parameters of other `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` in the System. Although any number of ControlMechanism can be
assigned to and executed within a System, a System can have only one `controller <System.controller>`, that is
executed after all of the other Components in the System have been executed, including any other ControlMechanisms (see
`System Execution <System_Execution>`). When a ControlMechanism is assigned to or created by a System, it inherits
specifications made for the System as follows:

  * the OutputPorts specified to be monitored in the System's **monitor_for_control** argument are added to those
    that may have already been specified for the ControlMechanism's `objective_mechanism
    <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` (the full set is listed in the ControlMechanism's `monitored_output_ports
    <EVCControlMechanism.monitored_output_ports>` attribute, and its ObjectiveMechanism's `monitored_output_ports
    <ObjectiveMechanism.monitored_output_ports>` attribute); see `System_Control_Specification` for additional details of how
    to specify OutputPorts to be monitored.

  * a `ControlSignal` and `ControlProjection` is assigned to the ControlMechanism for every parameter that has been
    `specified for control <ParameterPort_Specification>` in the System;  these are added to any that the
    ControlMechanism may already have (listed in its `control_signals <ControlMechanism.control_signals>` attribute).

See `System_Control_Specification` above, `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` and `ModulatorySignal_Modulation`
for details of how control operates, and `System_Execution_Control` below for a description of how it is engaged
when a System is executed. The control Components of a System can be displayed using the System's `show_graph
<System.show_graph>` method with its **show_control** argument assigned as `True`.

.. _System_Learning:

*Learning*
~~~~~~~~~~

A System cannot itself be specified for learning.  However, if learning has been specified for any of its `processes
<System.processes>`, then it will be `implemented <LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations>` and `executed
<System_Execution_Learning>` as part of the System.  Note, however, that for the learning Components of a Process to
be implemented by a System, learning must be `specified for the entire Process <Process_Learning_Specification>`. The
learning Components of a System can be displayed using the System's `System.show_graph` method with its
**show_learning** argument assigned as `True` or *ALL*.


.. _System_Execution:

Execution
---------

A System can be executed by calling either its `execute <System.execute>` or `run <System.execute>` methods.
`execute <System.execute>` executes the System once; that is, it executes a single `TRIAL`.
`run <System.run>` allows a series of `TRIAL`\\s to be executed, one for each input in the **inputs** argument
of the call to `run <System.run>`.  For each `TRIAL`, it makes a series of calls to the `run <Scheduler.run>`
method of the relevant `Scheduler` (see `System_Execution_Processing` and `System_Execution_Learning` below), and
executes the Components returned by that Scheduler (constituting a `TIME_STEP` of execution), until every Component in
the System has been executed at least once, or another `termination condition <Scheduler_Termination_Conditions>` is
met.  The execution of each `TRIAL` occurs in four phases: `initialization <System_Execution_Input_And_Initialization>`,
`processing <System_Execution_Processing>`, `learning <System_Execution_Learning>`, and
`control <System_Execution_Control>`, each of which is described below.


.. _System_Execution_Input_And_Initialization:

*Input and Initialization*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The input to a System is specified in the **input** argument of either its `execute <System.execute>` or
`run <System.run>` method. In both cases, the input for a single `TRIAL` must be a list or ndarray of values,
each of which is an appropriate input for the corresponding `ORIGIN` Mechanism (listed in the System's
`origin_mechanisms <System.origin_mechanisms>` attribute). If the `execute <System.execute>` method is used,
input for only a single `TRIAL` is provided, and only a single `TRIAL` is executed.  The `run <System.run>` method
can be used for a sequence of `TRIAL`\\s, by providing it with a list or ndarray of inputs, one for each `TRIAL`.  In
both cases, two other types of input can be provided in corresponding arguments of the `run <System.run>` method:
a list or ndarray of **initial_values**, and a list or ndarray of **target** values. The **initial_values** are
assigned at the start of a `TRIAL` as input to Mechanisms that close recurrent loops (designated as `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`,
and listed in the System's `recurrent_init_mechanisms <System.recurrent_init_mechanisms>` attribute), and
**target** values are assigned as the *TARGET* input of the System's `TARGET` Mechanisms (see
`System_Execution_Learning` below;  also, see `Run` for additional details of formatting input specifications).


.. _System_Execution_Processing:

*Processing*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the relevant inputs have been assigned, the `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` of the System are executed
in the order they are listed in the `Processes <Process>` used to construct the System.  When a Mechanism is executed,
it receives input from any other Mechanisms that project to it within the System,  but not from any Mechanisms outside
the System (PsyNeuLink does not support ESP).  The order of execution is determined by the System's `execution_graph`
attribute, which is a subset of the System's `graph <System.graph>` that has been "pruned" to be acyclic (i.e.,
devoid of recurrent loops (see `System_Graph` above).  While the `execution_graph` is acyclic, all recurrent Projections
in the System remain intact during execution and can be `initialized <System_Execution_Input_And_Initialization>` at
the start of execution. The order in which Components are executed can also be customized, using the System's
`System_Scheduler` in combination with `Condition` specifications for individual Components, to execute different
Components at different time scales, or to introduce dependencies among them (e.g., require that a recurrent Mechanism
settle before another one execute -- see `example <Condition_Recurrent_Example>`).


.. _System_Execution_Learning:

*Learning*
~~~~~~~~~~

A System executes learning if it is specified for one or more `Processes <Process_Learning_Sequence>` in the System.
The System's `learning <System.learning>` attribute indicates whether learning is enabled for the System. Learning
is executed for any Components (individual Projections or Processes) for which it is `specified
<Process_Learning_Sequence>` after the  `processing <System_Execution_Processing>` of each `TRIAL` has completed, but
before the `controller <System.controller> is executed <System_Execution_Control>`.

The learning Components of a System can be displayed using the System's `show_graph <System.show_graph>` method with its
**show_learning** argument assigned `True` or *ALL*. The target values used for learning can be specified in either of
two formats: dictionary or function, which are described in the `Run` module (see `Run_Targets`). Both formats require
that a target value be provided for each `TARGET` Mechanism of the System (listed in its `target_nodes
<System.target_nodes>` attribute).

.. note::
   A `TARGET` Mechanism of a Process is not necessarily one of the `TARGET` Mechanisms of the System to which it belongs
   (see `TARGET Mechanisms <LearningMechanism_Targets>`).  Also, the changes to a System induced by learning are not
   applied until the Mechanisms that receive the Projections being learned are next executed; see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation
   <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).


.. _System_Execution_Control:

*Control*
~~~~~~~~~

The System's `controller <System.controller>` is executed in the last phase of execution in a `TRIAL`, after all
other Mechanisms in the System have executed.  Although a System may have more than one `ControlMechanism`, only one
can be assigned as its `controller <System.controller>`;  all other ControlMechanisms are executed during the
`processing `System_Execution_Processing` phase of the `TRIAL` like any other Mechanism.  The `controller
<System.controller>` uses its `objective_mechanism <ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` to monitor and evaluate
the `OutputPort(s) <OutputPort>` of Mechanisms in the System; based on the information it receives from that
`ObjectiveMechanism`, it modulates the value of the parameters of Components in the System that have been `specified
for control <ControlMechanism_ControlSignals>`, which then take effect in the next `TRIAL` (see `System_Control` for
additional information about control). The control Components of a System can be displayed using the System's
`show_graph`method with its **show_control** argument assigned `True`.


.. _System_Examples:

Examples
--------
COMMENT
   XXX ADD EXAMPLES HERE FROM 'System Graph and Input Test Script'
   .. note::  All of the example Systems below use the following set of Mechanisms.  However, in practice, they must be
      created separately for each System;  using the same Mechanisms and Processes in multiple Systems can produce
      confusing results.

.. _System_Control_Examples:

*Specifying Control for a System*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following example specifies an `EVCControlMechanism` as the controller for a System with two `Processes <Process>`
that include two `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` (not shown)::

    my_system = System(processes=[TaskExecutionProcess, RewardProcess],
                       controller=EVCControlMechanism(objective_mechanism=
                                                   ObjectiveMechanism(
                                                       monitored_output_ports=[
                                                           Reward,
                                                           Decision.output_ports[PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD],
                                                           (Decision.output_ports[RESPONSE_TIME], -1, 1)]))
                                                       function=LinearCombination(operation=PRODUCT))

A constructor is used to specify the EVCControlMechanism that includes a constructor specifying its `objective_mechanism
<ControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>`;  the **monitored_output_ports** argument of the ObjectiveMechanism's constructor
is used to specify that it should monitor the `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` of the Reward Mechanism
and the *PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD* and *RESPONSE_TIME* and, specifying how it should combine them (see the `example
<ControlMechanism_Examples>` under ControlMechanism for an explanation). Note that the **function** argument for the
ObjectiveMechanism's constructor is also specified;  this is because an ObjectiveMechanism uses *SUM* as the default
for the `operation <LinearCombination.operation>` of its `LinearCombination` function, whereas as the EVCControlMechanism
requires *PRODUCT* -- in this case, to properly use the weight and exponents specified for the RESPONSE_TIME
OutputPort of Decision (see `note <EVCControlMechanism_Objective_Mechanism_Function_Note>` in EVCControlMechanism for
a more complete explanation).  Note that both the EVCControlMechanism and/or the ObjectiveMechanism could have been
constructed separately, and then referenced in the **controller** argument of ``my_system`` and **objective_mechanism**
argument of the EVCControlMechanism, respectively.

The same configuration can be specified in a more concise, though less "transparent" form, as follows::

    my_system = System(processes=[TaskExecutionProcess, RewardProcess],
                       controller=EVCControlMechanism(objective_mechanism=[
                                                             Reward,
                                                             Decision.output_ports[PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD],
                                                             (Decision.output_ports[RESPONSE_TIME], -1, 1)])))

Here, the constructor for the ObjectiveMechanism is elided, and the **objective_mechanism** argument for the
EVCControlMechanism is specified as a list of OutputPorts (see `ControlMechanism_ObjectiveMechanism`).

The specification can be made even simpler, but with some additional considerations that must be kept in mind,
as follows::

    my_system = System(processes=[TaskExecutionProcess, RewardProcess],
                       controller=EVCControlMechanism,
                       monitor_for_control=[Reward,
                                            PROBABILITY_UPPER_THRESHOLD,
                                            RESPONSE_TIME, 1, -1)],

Here, the *controller** for ``my_system`` is specified as the EVCControlMechanism, which will created a default
EVCControlMechanism. The OutputPorts to be monitored are specified in the **monitor_for_control** argument for
``my_system``.  Note that here they can be referenced simply by name; when ``my_system`` is created, it will search
all of its Mechanisms for OutputPorts with those names, and assign them to the `monitored_output_ports
<ObjectiveMechanism>` attribute of the EVCControlMechanism's `objective_mechanism
<EVCControlMechanism.objective_mechanism>` (see `System_Control_Specification` for a more detailed explanation of how
OutputPorts are assigned to be monitored by a System's `controller <System.controller>`).  While this form of the
specification is much simpler, it less flexible (i.e., it can't be used to customize the ObjectiveMechanism used by
the EVCControlMechanism or its `function <ObjectiveMechanism.function>`.

    Attributes
    ----------

    componentType : SYSTEM

    processes : list of Process objects
        list of `Processes <Process>` in the System specified by the **processes** argument of the constructor.

        .. can be appended with prediction Processes by EVCControlMechanism
           used with self.input to constsruct self.process_tuples

        .. _processList : ProcessList
            Provides access to (process, input) tuples.
            Derived from self.input and self.processes.
            Used to construct :py:data:`execution_graph <System.execution_graph>` and execute the System

    controller : ControlMechanism : default SystemDefaultControlMechanism
        the `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` used to monitor the `value <OutputPort.value>` of the `OutputPort(s)
        <OutputPort>` and/or `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` specified in the **monitor_for_control** argument,
        and that controls the parameters specified in the **control_signals** argument of the System's constructor.

    enable_controller :  bool : default :keyword:`False`
        determines whether the `controller <System.controller>` is executed during System execution.

    learning : bool : default False
        indicates whether learning is enabled for the System;  is set to `True` if learning is specified for any
        `Processes <Process>` in the System.

    learning_rate : float : default None
        determines the learning_rate for all `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism>` in the System.  This overrides any
        values set for the function of individual LearningMechanisms or `LearningSignals <LearningSignal>`, and persists
        for all subsequent executions of the System.  If it is set to `None`, then the `learning_rate
        <System.learning_rate>` is determined by last value assigned to each LearningMechanism (either directly,
        or following the execution of any `Process` or System to which the LearningMechanism belongs and for which a
        `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` was set).

    targets : 2d nparray
        used as template for the values of the System's `target_input_ports`, and to represent the targets specified in
        the **targets** argument of System's `execute <System.execute>` and `run <System.run>` methods.

    graph : OrderedDict
        contains a graph of all of the Components in the System. Each entry specifies a set of <Receiver>: {sender,
        sender...} dependencies.  The key of each entry is a receiver Component, and the value is a set of Mechanisms
        that send Projections to that receiver. If a key (receiver) has no dependents, its value is an empty set.

    execution_graph : OrderedDict
        contains an acyclic subset of the System's `graph <System.graph>`, hierarchically organized by a
        `toposort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting>`_. Used to specify the order in which
        Components are `executed <System_Execution>`.

    execution_sets : list of sets
        contains a list of Component sets. Each set contains Components to be executed at the same time.
        The sets are ordered in the sequence with which they should be executed.

    execution_list : list of Mechanisms and/or Projections
        contains a list of Components in the order in which they are `executed <System_Execution>`.
        The list is a random sample of the permissible orders constrained by the `execution_graph` and produced by the
        `toposort <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting>`_.

    mechanisms : list of Mechanism objects
        contains a list of all `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` in the System.

        .. property that points to _all_mechanisms.mechanisms (see below)

    mechanismsDict : Dict[Mechanism: Process]
        contains a dictionary of all Mechanisms in the System, listing the Processes to which they belong. The key of
        each entry is a `Mechanism <Mechanism>` object, and the value of each entry is a list of `Processes <Process>`.

        .. Note: the following attributes use lists of tuples (Mechanism, runtime_param, phaseSpec) and MechanismList
              xxx_mechs are lists of tuples defined in the Process pathways;
                  tuples are used because runtime_params and phaseSpec are attributes that need
                  to be able to be specified differently for the same Mechanism in different contexts
                  and thus are not easily managed as Mechanism attributes
              xxxMechanismLists point to MechanismList objects that provide access to information
                  about the Mechanism <type> listed in mechs (i.e., the Mechanisms, names, etc.)

        .. _all_mechs : list of (Mechanism, runtime_param, phaseSpec) tuples
            Tuples for all Mechanisms in the System (serve as keys in self.graph).

        .. _all_mechanisms : MechanismList
            Contains all Mechanisms in the System (based on _all_mechs).

        .. _origin_mechs : list of (Mechanism, runtime_param, phaseSpec) tuples
            Tuples for all ORIGIN Mechanisms in the System.

        .. _terminal_mechs : list of (Mechanism, runtime_param, phaseSpec) tuples
            Tuples for all TERMINAL Mechanisms in the System.

        .. _learning_mechs : list of (Mechanism, runtime_param, phaseSpec) tuples
            Tuples for all LearningMechanisms in the System.

        .. _target_mechs : list of (Mechanism, runtime_param, phaseSpec) tuples
            Tuples for all TARGET `ObjectiveMechanisms <ObjectiveMechanism>`  in the System that are a `TERMINAL`
            for at least one Process to which it belongs and that Process has learning enabled --  the criteria for
            being a target used in learning.

        .. _learning_mechs : list of (Mechanism, runtime_param, phaseSpec) tuples
            Tuples for all LearningMechanisms in the System (used for learning).

        .. _control_mechs : list of a single (Mechanism, runtime_param, phaseSpec) tuple
            Tuple for the controller in the System.

    origin_mechanisms : MechanismList
        all `ORIGIN` Mechanisms in the System (i.e., that don't receive `Projections <Projection>` from any other
        `Mechanisms <Mechanism>`, listed in ``origin_mechanisms.data``.

        .. based on _origin_mechs
           System.input contains the input to each `ORIGIN` Mechanism

    terminalMechanisms : MechanismList
        all `TERMINAL` Mechanisms in the System (i.e., that don't project to any other `ProcessingMechanisms
        <ProcessingMechanism>`), listed in ``terminalMechanisms.data``.

        .. based on _terminal_mechs
           System.ouput contains the output of each TERMINAL Mechanism

    recurrent_init_mechanisms : MechanismList
        `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` with recurrent `Projections <Projection>` that are candidates for `initialization
        <System_Execution_Input_And_Initialization>`, listed in ``recurrent_init_mechanisms.data``.

    learning_mechanisms : MechanismList
        all `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism>` in the System, listed in ``learning_mechanisms.data``.

    target_mechanisms : MechanismList
        all `TARGET` Mechanisms in the System (used for `learning <System_Execution_Learning>`), listed in
        ``target_nodes.data``.
        COMMENT:
            based on _target_mechs)
        COMMENT

    target_input_ports : List[SystemInputPort]
        one item for each `TARGET` Mechanism in the System (listed in its `target_nodes
        <System.target_mechansims>` attribute).  Used to represent the values specified in the **targets**
        argument of the System's `execute <System.execute>` and `run <System.run>` methods, and to provide
        thoese values to the TARGET `InputPort` of each `TARGET` Mechanism during `execution
        <System_Execution_Learning>`.


        .. control_mechanism : MechanismList
            contains the `ControlMechanism <ControlMechanism>` that is the `controller <System.controller>` of the
            System.
            COMMENT:
                ??and any other `ControlMechanisms <ControlMechanism>` in the System
                (based on _control_mechs).
            COMMENT

    value : 3D ndarray
        contains an array of 2D arrays, each of which is the `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` of a
        `TERMINAL` Mechanism in the System.

        .. _phaseSpecMax : int
            Maximum phase specified for any Mechanism in System.  Determines the phase of the last (set of)
            ProcessingMechanism(s) to be executed in the System.

        .. numPhases : int
            number of phases for System (read-only).

            .. implemented as an @property attribute; = _phaseSpecMax + 1

    initial_values : list or ndarray of values
        values used to initialize Mechanisms that close recurrent loops (designated as `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`).
        Length must equal the number of `INITIALIZE_CYCLE` Mechanisms listed in the System's
        `recurrent_init_mechanisms <System.recurrent_init_mechanisms>` attribute.

    results : List[OutputPort.value]
        list of return values from the sequence of executions.  Each item is a 2d array containing the `output_values
        <Mechanism.output_values>` of each `TERMINAL` Mechanism of the System for a given execution.
        Excludes simulated runs.

    simulation_results : List[OutputPort.value]
        list of return values from the sequence of executions in simulation run(s) of the System; requires
        recordSimulationPref to be `True`.  Each item is a 2d array containing the `output_values
        <Mechanism.output_values>` of each `TERMINAL` Mechanism in the System for a given execution in the simulation.
        Excludes values from non-simulation runs.

    name : str
        the name of the System; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a default is
        assigned by SystemRegistry (see `Naming` for conventions used for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the System; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of the
        constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet
        <LINK>` for details).

        """Run a sequence of executions

        Call execute method for each execution in a sequence specified by inputs.  See :doc:`Run` for details of
        formatting input specifications. The **animate** argument can be used to generate a movie of the execution of
        the System.

        .. note::
           Use of the animation argument relies on `imageio <http://imageio.github.io>`_, which must be
           installed and imported (standard with PsyNeuLink pip install)

        Arguments
        ---------

        inputs : List[input] or ndarray(input) : default default_variable for a single execution
            the input for each in a sequence of executions (see :doc:`Run` for detailed description of formatting
            requirements and options).

        initialize : bool default :keyword:`False`
            if `True`, calls the :py:meth:`initialize <System.initialize>` method of the System before a
            sequence of executions.

        initial_values : Dict[Mechanism: List[input] or np.ndarray(input)] : default None
            the initial values assigned to Mechanisms designated as `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`.

        targets : List[input] or np.ndarray(input) : default `None`
            the target values for the LearningMechanisms of the System for each execution.
            The length (of the outermost level if a nested list, or lowest axis if an ndarray) must be equal to that
            of ``inputs``.

        learning : bool :  default `None`
            enables or disables learning during execution.
            If it is not specified, the current state is left intact.
            If it is `True`, learning is forced on; if it is :keyword:`False`, learning is forced off.

        call_before_trial : Function : default `None`
            called before each trial in the sequence is executed.

        call_after_trial : Function : default `None`
            called after each trial in the sequence is executed.

        call_before_time_step : Function : default `None`
            called before each time_step of each trial is executed.

        call_after_time_step : Function : default `None`
            called after each time_step of each trial is executed.

        termination_processing : Dict[TimeScale: Condition]
            a dictionary containing `Condition`\\ s that signal the end of the associated `TimeScale` within the :ref:`processing
            phase of execution <System_Execution_Processing>`

        termination_learning : Dict[TimeScale: Condition]
            a dictionary containing `Condition`\\ s that signal the end of the associated `TimeScale` within the :ref:`learning
            phase of execution <System_Execution_Learning>`

        reinitialize_values : Dict[Mechanism: List[reinitialization values] or np.ndarray(reinitialization values)
            a dictionary containing Mechanism: value pairs. Each Mechanism in the dictionary calls its `reinitialize
            <Mechanism_Base.reinitialize>` method at the start of the Run. The Mechanism's value in the
            reinitialize_values dictionary is passed into its `reinitialize <Mechanism_Base.reinitialize>` method. See
            the `reinitialize method <IntegratorFunction.reinitialize>` of the `function <Mechanism_Base.function>`
            or `integrator_function <TransferMechanism.integrator_function>` of the Mechanism for details on which
            values must be passed in as arguments. Keep in mind that only stateful Mechanisms may be reinitialized, and
            that Mechanisms in reinitialize_values will reinitialize regardless of whether their `reinitialize_when
            <Component.reinitialize_when>` Condition is satisfied.

        animate : dict or bool : False
            specifies use of the `show_graph <System.show_graph>` method to generate a gif movie showing the sequence
            of Components executed in a trial.  A dict can be specified containing options to pass to the `show_graph
            <System.show_graph>` method;  each key must be an argument of the `show_graph <System.show_graph>`
            method, and its value a specification for that argument.  The entries listed below can also be included
            in the dict to specify parameters of the animation.  If the **animate** argument is specified simply as
            `True`, defaults are used for all arguments of `show_graph <System.show_graph>` and the options below:

            * *UNIT*: *EXECUTION_SET* or *COMPONENT* (default=\\ *EXECUTION_SET*\\ ) -- specifies which Components to
              treat as active in each call to `show_graph <System.show_graph>`. *COMPONENT* generates an image for the
              execution of each Component.  *EXECUTION_SET* generates an image for each `execution_set
              <System.execution_sets>`, showing all of the Components in that set as active.

            * *DURATION*: float (default=0.75) -- specifies the duration (in seconds) of each image in the movie.

            * *NUM_TRIALS*: int (default=1) -- specifies the number of trials to animate;  by default, this is 1.
              If the number specified is less than the total number of trials being run, only the number specified are
              animated; if it is greater than the number of trials being run, only the number being run are animated.

            * *MOVIE_NAME*: str (default=\\ `name <System.name>` + 'movie') -- specifies the name to be used for the
              movie file; it is automatically appended with '.gif'.

            * *SAVE_IMAGES*: bool (default=\\ `False`\\ ) -- specifies whether to save each of the images used to
              construct the animation in separate gif files, in addition to the file containing the animation.

            * *SHOW*: bool (default=\\ `False`\\ ) -- specifies whether to show the animation after it is constructed,
              using the OS's default viewer.

        Examples
        --------

        This figure shows an animation of the System in the Multilayer-Learning example script, with
        the show_graph **show_learning** argument specified as *ALL*:

        By default, only the primary processing Components are shown, and Mechanisms are displayed as simple nodes.
        However, the **show_mechanism_structure** argument can be used to display more detailed information about
        each Mechanism, including its Ports and, optionally, the `function <Component.function>` and `value
        <Component.value>` of the Mechanism and each of its Ports (using the **show_functions** and **show_values**
        arguments, respectively).  The **show_dimension** argument can be used to display the dimensions of each
        Mechanism and Projection.  The **show_processes** argument arranges Mechanisms and Projections into the
        Processes to which they belong. The **show_learning** and **show_control** arguments can be used to
        show the Components associated with `learning <LearningMechanism>` and those associated with the
        System's `controller <System_Control>`.

        `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` are always displayed as nodes.  If **show_mechanism_structure** is `True`,
        Mechanism nodes are subdivided into sections for its Ports with information about each determined by the
        **show_values** and **show_functions** specifications.  Otherwise, Mechanism nodes are simple ovals.
        `ORIGIN` and  `TERMINAL` Mechanisms of the System are displayed with thicker borders in a colors specified
        for each. `Projections <Projection>` are displayed as labelled arrows, unless **show_learning** is specified,
        in which case `MappingProjections <MappingProjection> are displayed as diamond-shaped nodes, and any
        `LearningProjections <LearningProjecction>` as labelled arrows that point to them.

        .. note::
           There are two unresolved anomalies associated with show_graph (it is uncertain whether they are bugs in
           PsyNeuLink, Graphviz, or an interaction between the two):

           1) When both **show_mechanism_structure** and **show_processes** are specified together with
              **show_learning** and/or **show_control**, under some arcane conditions Projection arrows can be
              distorted and/or orphaned.  We have confirmed that this does not reflect a corruption of the underlying
              graph structure, and the System should execute normally.

           2) Specifying **show_processes** but not setting **show_headers** to `False` raises a GraphViz exception;
              to deal with this, if **show_processes** is specified, **show_headers** is automatically set to `False`.

           Examples of renderings generated by the show_graph method with different options specified, and the call
           to the show_graph method used to generate each rendering shown below each example. **Panel A** shows the

           and the `TERMINAL` Mechanism in green.  **Panel B** shows the same graph with `MappingProjection` names
           and Component dimensions displayed.  **Panel C** shows the learning Components of the System displayed (in
           orange).  **Panel D** shows the control Components of the System displayed (in blue).  **Panel E** shows
           both learning and control Components;  the learning components are shown with all `LearningProjections
           <LearningProjection>` shown (by specifying show_learning=pnl.ALL).  **Panel F** shows a detailed view of
           the Processing Components, using the show_mechanism_structure option, that includes Component labels and
           values.  **Panel G** show a simpler rendering using the show_mechanism_structure, that only shows
           Component names, but includes the control Components (using the show_control option).

            Process, it is shown in a separate box along with any others that belong to the same combination of
            Processes;  these represent intersections of Processes within the System.

        show_mechanism_structure : bool, VALUES, FUNCTIONS or ALL : default False
            specifies whether or not to show a detailed representation of each `Mechanism <Mechanism>` in the graph,
            including its `Ports`;  can have the following settings:

            * `True` -- shows Ports of Mechanism, but not information about the `value
              <Component.value>` or `function <Component.function>` of the Mechanism or its Ports.

            * *VALUES* -- shows the `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` of the Mechanism and the `value
              <Port_Base.value>` of each of its Ports.

            * *LABELS* -- shows the `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` of the Mechanism and the `value
              <Port_Base.value>` of each of its Ports, using any labels for the values of InputPorts and
              OutputPorts specified in the Mechanism's `input_labels_dict <Mechanism.input_labels_dict>` and
              `output_labels_dict <Mechanism.output_labels_dict>`, respectively.

            * *FUNCTIONS* -- shows the `function <Mechanism_Base.function>` of the Mechanism and the `function
              <Port_Base.function>` of its InputPorts and OutputPorts.

            * *ROLES* -- shows the `role <System_Mechanisms>` of the Mechanism in the System in square brackets
              (but not any of the other information;  use *ALL* to show ROLES with other information).

            * *ALL* -- shows both `value <Component.value>` and `function <Component.function>` of the Mechanism and
              its Ports (using labels for the values, if specified;  see above).

            Any combination of the settings above can also be specified in a list that is assigned to
            show_mechanism_structure

        COMMENT:
            and, optionally, the `function <Component.function>` and `value <Component.value>` of each (these
            can be specified using the **show_functions** and **show_values** arguments.  If this option is
            specified, Projections are connected to and from the Port that is the `sender <Projection_Base.sender>`
            or `receiver <Projection_Base.receiver>` of each.
        COMMENT

        show_headers : bool : default False
            specifies whether or not to show headers in the subfields of a Mechanism's node;  only takes effect if
            **show_mechanism_structure** is specified (see above).

        COMMENT:
        show_functions : bool : default False
            specifies whether or not to show `function <Component.function>` of Mechanisms and their Ports in the
            graph (enclosed by parentheses);  this requires **show_mechanism_structure** to be specified as `True`
            to take effect.

        show_values : bool : default False
            specifies whether or not to show `value <Component.value>` of Mechanisms and their Ports in the graph
            (prefixed by "=");  this requires **show_mechanism_structure** to be specified as `True` to take effect.
        COMMENT

        show_projection_labels : bool : default False
            specifies whether or not to show names of projections.

        show_learning : bool or ALL : default False
            specifies whether or not to show the learning components of the system;
            they will all be displayed in the color specified for **learning_color**.
            Projections that receive a `LearningProjection` will be shown as a diamond-shaped node.
            if set to *ALL*, all Projections associated with learning will be shown:  the LearningProjections
            as well as from `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` to `LearningMechanisms <LearningMechanism>`
            that convey error and activation information;  if set to `True`, only the LearningPojections are shown.

        show_control :  bool : default False
            specifies whether or not to show the control components of the system;
            they will all be displayed in the color specified for **control_color**.

        show_prediction_mechanisms :  bool : default False
            specifies whether or not to show the `PredictionMechanisms <Prediction_Mechanism>` for the
            `controller <System.controller>` of the System; they will be displayed in the color specified for
            **prediction_mechanism_color**.  Only applicable if **show_control** is `True`.

        show_roles : bool : default False
            specifies whether or not to include the `role <System_Mechanisms>` that each Mechanism plays in the System
            (enclosed by square brackets); 'ORIGIN' and 'TERMINAL' Mechanisms are also displayed in a color specified
            by the **origin_color**, **terminal_color** and **origin_and_terminal_color** arguments (see below).

        show_dimensions : bool, MECHANISMS, PROJECTIONS or ALL : default False
            specifies whether or not to show dimensions of Mechanisms (and/or MappingProjections when show_learning
            is `True`);  can have the following settings:

            * *MECHANISMS* -- shows `Mechanism <Mechanism>` input and output dimensions.  Input dimensions are shown
              in parentheses below the name of the Mechanism; each number represents the dimension of the `variable
              <InputPort.variable>` for each `InputPort` of the Mechanism; Output dimensions are shown above
              the name of the Mechanism; each number represents the dimension for `value <OutputPort.value>` of each
              of `OutputPort` of the Mechanism.

            * *PROJECTIONS* -- shows `MappingProjection` `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` dimensions.  Each is
              shown in (<dim>x<dim>...) format;  for standard 2x2 "weight" matrix, the first entry is the number of
              rows (input dimension) and the second the number of columns (output dimension).

            * *ALL* -- eqivalent to `True`; shows dimensions for both Mechanisms and Projections (see above for
              formats).

        direction : keyword : default 'BT'
            'BT': bottom to top; 'TB': top to bottom; 'LR': left to right; and 'RL`: right to left.

        active_items : List[Component] : default None
            specifies one or more items in the graph to display in the color specified by *active_color**.

        active_color : keyword : default 'yellow'
            specifies how to highlight the item(s) specified in *active_items**:  either a color recognized
            by GraphViz, or the keyword *BOLD*.

        origin_color : keyword : default 'green',
            specifies the color in which the `ORIGIN` Mechanisms of the System are displayed.

        terminal_color : keyword : default 'red',
            specifies the color in which the `TERMINAL` Mechanisms of the System are displayed.

        origin_and_terminal_color : keyword : default 'brown'
            specifies the color in which Mechanisms that are both
            an `ORIGIN` and a `TERMINAL` of the System are displayed.

        learning_color : keyword : default `green`
            specifies the color in which the learning components are displayed.

        control_color : keyword : default `blue`
            specifies the color in which the learning components are displayed (note: if the System's
            `controller <System.controller>` is an `EVCControlMechanism`, then a link is shown in pink from the
            `prediction Mechanisms <EVCControlMechanism_Prediction_Mechanisms>` it creates to the corresponding
            `ORIGIN` Mechanisms of the System, to indicate that although no projection are created for these,
            the prediction Mechanisms determine the input to the `ORIGIN` Mechanisms when the EVCControlMechanism
            `simulates execution <EVCControlMechanism_Execution>` of the System).

        prediction_mechanism_color : keyword : default `pink`
            specifies the color in which the `prediction_mechanisms
            <EVCControlMechanism.prediction_mechanisms>` are displayed for a System using an `EVCControlMechanism`

        system_color : keyword : default `purple`
            specifies the color in which the node representing input from the System is displayed.

        output_fmt : keyword : default 'pdf'
            'pdf': generate and open a pdf with the visualization;
            'jupyter': return the object (ideal for working in jupyter/ipython notebooks).

        Returns
        -------

        display of system : `pdf` or Graphviz graph object
            'pdf' (placed in current directory) if :keyword:`output_fmt` arg is 'pdf';

    A SystemInputPort is created for each `InputPort` of each `ORIGIN` Mechanism in `origin_mechanisms`, and for the
    *TARGET* `InputPort <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>` of each `ComparatorMechanism <ComparatorMechanism>` listed
    in `target_nodes <System.target_nodes>`.  A `MappingProjection` is created that projects to each

    `run <System.run>` method is called, each item of its **inputs** and **targets** arguments is assigned as
    the `value <SystemInputPort.value>` of a SystemInputPort, which is then conveyed to the
    corresponding InputPort of the `origin_mechanisms <System.origin_mechanisms>` and `terminal_mechanisms
