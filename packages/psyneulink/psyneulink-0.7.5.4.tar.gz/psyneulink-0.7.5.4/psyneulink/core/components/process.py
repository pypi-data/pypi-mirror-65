.. _Process_Overview:

Overview
--------

A Process is the simplest form of `Composition <Composition>`, made up of a `lineal <Process_Footnotes>` sequence of
`Mechanisms <Mechanism>` linked by `Projections <Projection>`.  Processes can be executed on their own, but most
commonly they are used to compose a `System`, which is the most powerful form of Composition in PsyNeuLink.  Processes
are nevertheless useful, as they define a simpler unit of processing than a System (e.g., for debugging, or for use in
multiple Systems), and are used as the unit of `learning <System_Learning>` within a System.  The general features of
Processes are summarized below, followed by a more detailed description in the sections that follow.

Mechanisms and Projections are composed into a Process by assigning them to the Process' `pathway
<Process.pathway>` attribute. Executing a Process executes all of its Mechanisms in the order in which they are
listed in its `pathway  <Process.pathway>`.  Projections can be specified among any Mechanisms in a Process,
including to themselves, however they must compose a `lineal <Process_Footnotes>` sequence.  A Process cannot involve
any "branching" (beyond what may be produced by recurrent loops within the Process); that must be done by using a
Process  to compose each branch, and then composing the Processes into a  `System`. Mechanisms in a Process can project
to and  receive Projections from Mechanisms in other Processes, however these will not have any effect when the Process
is  executed; these will only have an effect if all of the Processes involved are members of the same System and the
`System is executed <System_Execution_Processing>`.

Projections between Mechanisms can be trained by `specifying them for learning
<MappingProjection_Learning_Specification>`.  Learning can also be `specified for the entire Process
<Process_Learning_Specification>`, in which case all of the Projections among Mechanisms in the Process are trained
(see `Process_Learning_Sequence` below).

.. _Process_Creation:

Creating a Process
------------------

A Process is created by instantiating the `Process` class. The Mechanisms to be included are specified in a list in its
**pathway** argument, in the order in which they should be executed by the Process.  The Mechanism entries can be
separated by `Projections <Projection>` used to connect them.  If no arguments are provided to the **pathway** argument,
a Process with an empty pathway is created.

.. _Process_Structure:

Structure
---------

.. _Process_Pathway:

*Pathway*
~~~~~~~~~

A Process is defined by its `pathway <Process.pathway>` attribute, which is a list of `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` and
`Projections <Projection>`, that are executed in the order in which they are specified in the list. Each Mechanism in
the `pathway <Process.pathway>` must project at least to the next one in the `pathway <Process.pathway>`,
though it can project to others, and receive recurrent (feedback) Projections from them.  However, a `pathway
<Process.pathway>` cannot include branching patterns beyond any produced by recurrent loops (see `Examples
<Process_Examples>` below);  that is, a Mechanism cannot project to another Mechanism that falls outside the `lineal
<Process_Footnotes>` sequence of the `pathway <Process.pathway>` To compose more complex, branched, structures,
a Process should be created for each "branch", and these used to compose a `System <System_Creation>`.

The Mechanisms specified in the `pathway` for a Process must be `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>`, and
the projections between Mechanisms in a Process must be `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`.  These transmit the
output of a Mechanism (the Projection's `sender <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.sender>`) to the input of
another Mechanism (the Projection's `receiver <MappingProjection.MappingProjection.receiver>`). Specification of a
`pathway` requires, at the least, a list of Mechanisms.  Each of these can be specified directly, or using a **tuple**
that also contains a set of `runtime parameters <Mechanism_Runtime_Parameters>` (see `below
<Process_Mechanism_Specification>`). A Projection between a pair of Mechanisms can be specified by interposing it in
the list between the pair.  If no Projection is specified between two adjacent Mechanisms in the `pathway
<Process.pathway>`, and there is no otherwise specified Projection between them, a default MappingProjection is
automatically created when the Process is created that projects from the first to the second member of the pair.
Specifying the Components of a pathway is described in detail below.

.. _Process_Mechanisms:

*Mechanisms*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Mechanisms <Mechanism>` of a Process must be listed explicitly in the **pathway** argument of the `Process`
class, in the order they are to be executed when the Process (or any System to which it belongs) is `executed
<Process_Execution>`.  The first Mechanism in a Process is designated as its `ORIGIN` Mechanism, and is assigned to its
`origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` attribute; it receives as its input any `input
<Process_Input_And_Output>` provided to the Process' `execute <Process.execute>` or `run <Process.run>`
methods. The last Mechanism listed in the `pathway <Process.pathway>` is designated as the `TERMINAL` Mechanism,
and is assigned to its `terminal_mechanism <Process.terminal_mechanism>` attribute; its `output_values
<Mechanism_Base.output_values>` is assigned as the `output <Process_Output>` of the Process.

.. _Process_Mechanism_Initialize_Cycle:

Any Mechanism that sends a Projection that closes a recurrent loop within the `pathway <Process.pathway>` is
designated as `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`; whenever that Mechanism is `initialized <Process_Execution_Initialization>`,
it is assigned the value specified for it in the **initial_values** argument of the Process' `execute
<Process.execute>` or `run <Process.run>` methods. Mechanisms that receive a Projection from one designated
`INITIALIZE_CYCLE` are themselves designated as `CYCLE`.  All other Mechanisms in the `pathway <Process.pathway>`
are designated as `INTERNAL`.

.. note::
   The `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` and `terminal_mechanism <Process.terminal_mechanism>`
   of a Process are not necessarily the `ORIGIN` and/or `TERMINAL` Mechanisms of the System(s)to which the Process
   belongs (see `example <LearningProjection_Output_vs_Terminal_Figure>`).  The designations of a Mechanism's status
   in the Process(es) to which it belongs are listed in its `processes <Mechanism_Base.processes>` attribute.

.. _Process_Mechanism_Specification:

Mechanisms can be specified in the **pathway** argument of the `Process` class in one of two ways:

    * **Directly** -- using any of the ways used to `specify a Mechanism <Mechanism_Creation>`.
    ..
    * **MechanismTuple** -- the first item must be a specification for the Mechanism using any of the ways used to
      `specify a Mechanism <Mechanism_Creation>`;  the second must be a set of `runtime parameters
      <Mechanism_Runtime_Parameters>`. Runtime parameters are used for that Mechanism when the Process (or a System
      to which it belongs) is executed; otherwise they do not remain associated with the Mechanism.

The same Mechanism can appear more than once in a `pathway <Process.pathway>`, as one means of generating a
recurrent processing loop (another is to specify this in the Projections -- see below).

.. _Process_Projections:

*Projections*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` between Mechanisms in the `pathway <Process.pathway>` of a Process can be
specified in any of the following ways:

  * **Inline specification** -- a MappingProjection specification can be interposed between any two Mechanisms in the
    `pathway <Process.pathway>` list. This creates a Projection from the preceding Mechanism in the list to the
    one that follows it.  It can be specified using any of the ways used to `specify a Projection
    <Projection_Specification>` or the `matrix parameter <MappingProjection_Matrix_Specification>` of one.
  ..

  .. _Process_Tuple_Specification:

  * **Tuple learning specification** -- this can be used in the same way as an inline specification;  the first item
    must a MappingProjection specification that takes the same form as an inline specification, and the second must be
    a `learning specification <MappingProjection_Learning_Tuple_Specification>`.
  ..
  * **Stand-alone MappingProjection** -- when a Projection is `created <Projection_Creation>` on its own,
    it can be assigned a `sender <Projection_Sender>` and/or a `receiver <Projection_Receiver>`
    Mechanism. If both are in the Process, then that Projection will be used when creating the Process.  Stand-alone
    specification of a MappingProjection between two Mechanisms in a Process takes precedence over any other
    form of specification; that is, the stand-alone Projection will be used in place of any that is specified between
    the Mechanisms in a `pathway <Process.pathway>`. Stand-alone specification is required to implement
    MappingProjections between Mechanisms that are not adjacent to one another in the `pathway <Process.pathway>`.
  ..
  * **Default assignment** -- for any Mechanism that does not receive a MappingProjection from another Mechanism in the
    Process (specified using one of the methods above), a `MappingProjection` is automatically created from the
    Mechanism that precedes it in the `pathway <Process.pathway>`. If the format of the `value <OutputPort.value>`
    of the preceding Mechanism's `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` matches that of the next Mechanism, then an
    `IDENTITY_MATRIX` is used for the Projection's `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter;  if the formats do not
    match, or `learning has been specified <Process_Learning_Sequence>` either for the Projection or the Process, then a
    `FULL_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` is used.  If the Mechanism is the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`
    (i.e., first in the `pathway <Process.pathway>`), a `ProcessInputPort <Process_Input_And_Output>` is used
    as the `sender <MappingProjection.sender>`, and an `IDENTITY_MATRIX` is used for the MappingProjection.

.. _Process_Input_And_Output:

*Process input and output*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `input <Process.input>` of a Process is a list or 2d np.array provided as the **input** argument in its
`execute <Process.execute>` method, or the **inputs** argument of its `run <Process.run>` method. When a
Process is created, a set of `ProcessInputPorts <ProcessInputPort>` (listed in its `process_input_ports` attribute)
and `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` are automatically created to transmit the Process' `input
<Process.input>` to its `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`, as follows:

    * if the number of items in the **input** is the same as the number of `InputPorts <InputPort>` for the
      `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`, a MappingProjection is created for each item of the input to a
      distinct InputPort of the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`;
    ..
    * if the **input** has only one item but the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` has more than one
      InputPort, a single `ProcessInputPort <ProcessInputPort>` is created with Projections to each of the
      `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`'s InputPorts;
    ..
    * if the **input** has more than one item but the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` has only one
      InputPort, a `ProcessInputPort <ProcessInputPort>` is created for each item of the input, and all project to
      the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`'s InputPort;
    ..
    * otherwise, if the **input** has more than one item and the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` has
      more than one InputPort, but the numbers are not equal, an error message is generated indicating that there is an
      ambiguous mapping from the Process' **input** value to `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`'s
      InputPorts.

.. _Process_Output:

The output of a Process is assigned as the `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute of its `TERMINAL`
Mechanism.

.. _Process_Learning_Sequence:

*Learning*
~~~~~~~~~~

Learning operates over a *learning sequence*: a contiguous sequence of `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` in
a Process `pathway <Process.pathway>`, and the `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` between them, that have
been specified for learning. Learning modifies the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter of the
MappingProjections in the sequence, so that the input to the first ProcessingMechanism in the sequence generates an
output from the last ProcessingMechanism that matches as closely as possible the target specified for the sequence
(see `Process_Execution_Learning` below for a more detailed description).

.. _Process_Learning_Specification:

Learning can be `specified for individual (or subsets of) MappingProjections
<MappingProjection_Learning_Specification>`, or for the entire Process.  It is specified for the entire process by
assigning a specification for a `LearningProjection <LearningProjection_Creation>` or `LearningSignal
<LearningSignal_Specification>` specification, or the keyword *ENABLED*, to the **learning** argument of the
Process' constructor.  Specifying learning for a Process implements it for all MappingProjections in the Process (except
those that project from the `process_input_ports` to the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`), which
are treated as a single learning sequence.  Mechanisms that receive MappingProjections for which learning has been
specified must be compatible with learning (that is, their `function <Mechanism_Base.function>` must be compatible with
the `function <LearningMechanism.function>` of the `LearningMechanism` for the MappingProjections they receive (see
`LearningMechanism_Function`).

.. _Process_Learning_Components:

The following Components are created for each learning sequence specified for a Process (see figure below):

    * a `TARGET` `ComparatorMechanism` (assigned to the Process' `target_nodes <Process.target_nodes>`
      attribute), that is used to `calculate an error signal <ComparatorMechanism_Execution>` for the sequence, by
      comparing `a specified output <LearningMechanism_Activation_Output>` of the last Mechanism in the learning
      sequence (received in the ComparatorMechanism's *SAMPLE* `InputPort <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>`) with the
      item of the **target** argument in Process' `execute <Process.execute>` or `run <Process.run>` method
      corresponding to the learning sequence (received in the ComparatorMechanism's *TARGET* `InputPort
      <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>`).
    ..
    * a MappingProjection that projects from the last ProcessingMechanism in the sequence to the *SAMPLE* `InputPort
      <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>` of the `TARGET` Mechanism;
    ..
    * a ProcessingInputPort to represent the corresponding item of the **target** argument of the Process' `execute
      <Process.execute>` and `run <Process.run>` methods;
    ..
    * a MappingProjection that projects from the `ProcessInputPort <ProcessInputPort>` for the **target** item to the
      *TARGET* `InputPort <ComparatorMechanism_Structure>` of the `TARGET` Mechanism;
    ..
    * a `LearningMechanism` for each MappingProjection in the sequence that calculates the `learning_signal
      <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` used to modify the `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter for that
      MappingProjection, along with a `LearningSignal` and `LearningProjection` that convey the `learning_signal
      <LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` to the MappingProjection's *MATRIX* `ParameterPort
      <Mapping_Matrix_ParameterPort>` (additional MappingProjections are created for the LearningMechanism -- see
      `LearningMechanism_Learning_Configurations` for details).

    .. note::
       The Components created when learning is specified for individual MappingProjections of a Process (or subsets of
       them) take effect only if the Process is executed on its own (i.e., using its `execute <Process.execute>`
       or `run <Process.run>` methods.  For learning to in a Process when it is `executed as part of a System
       <System_Execution_Learning>`, learning must be specified for the *entire Process*, as described above.

COMMENT:
    XXX ?HOW:
    Different learning algorithms can be specified (e.g., `Reinforcement` or `BackPropagation`), that implement the
    Mechanisms and LearningSignals required for the specified type of learning. However,  as noted above,
    all Mechanisms that receive Projections being learned must be compatible with learning.

   :alt: Schematic of LearningMechanism and LearningProjections in a Process

   Learning using the `BackPropagation` learning algorithm in a three-layered network, using a `TransferMechanism` for
   each layer (capitalized labels in Mechanism components are their `designated roles
   <Mechanism_Role_In_Processes_And_Systems>` in the Process -- see also `Process_Mechanisms` and `Keywords`).

.. _Process_Execution:

Execution
---------

A Process can be executed as part of a `System <System_Execution>` or on its own.  On its own, it is executed by calling
either its `execute <Process.execute>` or `run <Process.run>` method.  `execute <Process.execute>` executes
the Process once (that is, it executes a single `TRIAL`);  `run <Process.run>` allows a series of `TRIAL`\\s to be
executed.

. _Process_Processing

*Processing*
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a Process is executed, its `input` is conveyed to the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`
(the first Mechanism in the `pathway <Process.pathway>`).  By default, the input is presented only once.  If
the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` is executed again in the same `PASS` of execution (e.g., if it
appears again in the pathway, or receives recurrent projections), the input is not presented again. However, the input
can be "clamped" on using the **clamp_input** argument of `execute <Process.execute>` or `run <Process.run>`.
After the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` is executed, each subsequent Mechanism in the `pathway` is
executed in sequence.  If a Mechanism is specified in the pathway using a `MechanismTuple
<Process_Mechanism_Specification>`, then the `runtime parameters <Mechanism_Runtime_Parameters>` are applied and the
Mechanism is executed using them (see `Mechanism <Mechanism_ParameterPorts>` for parameter specification).  Finally the
output of the `terminal_mechanism <Process.terminal_mechanism>` (the last one in the pathway) is assigned as the
`output <Process_Output>` of the Process.

.. note::
   Processes do not use a `Scheduler`; each Mechanism is executed once, in the order listed in its `pathway` attribute.
   To more precisely control the order of, and/or any dependencies in, the sequence of executions, the Process
   should be used to construct a `System`, together with `Conditions <Condition>` to implement a custom schedule.


.. _Process_Execution_Initialization

The `input <Process_Input_And_Output>` to a Process is specified in the **input** argument of either its `execute
<Process.execute>` or `run <Process.run>` method. In both cases, the input for a single `TRIAL` must be a
number, list or ndarray of values that is compatible with the `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` of the
`origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`. If the `execute <Process.execute>` method is used, input for
only a single `TRIAL` is provided, and only a single `TRIAL` is executed.  The `run <System.run>` method can be
used for a sequence of `TRIAL`\\s, by providing it with a list or ndarray of inputs, one for each `TRIAL`.  In both
cases, two other types of input can be provided in corresponding arguments of the `execute <Process.execute>`
and `run <Process.run>` methods: a  list or ndarray of **initial_values**, and a list or ndarray of **target**
values. The **initial_values** are assigned as input to Mechanisms that close recurrent loops (designated as
`INITIALIZE_CYCLE`) at the start of a `TRIAL` (if **initialize** is set to `True`), and/or whenever the Process`
`initialize <Process.initialize>` method is called; **target** values are assigned as the *TARGET* input of the
`target_nodes <Process.target_nodes>` in each `TRIAL` of execution, if `learning
<Process_Learning_Sequence>` has been specified (see the next setion for how Learning is executed; also,
see `Run` documentation for additional details of formatting `Run_Input` and `Run_Target` specifications of the
`run <Process.run>` method).

.. _Process_Execution_Learning:

*Learning*
~~~~~~~~~~

If `learning <Process_Learning_Sequence>` has been specified for the Process or any of the projections in its `pathway
<Process.pathway>`, then the learning Components described `above <Process_Learning_Components>` are executed after
all of the ProcessingMechanisms in the `pathway <Process.pathway>` have executed.  The learning Components
calculate changes that will be  made to `matrix <MappingProjection.matrix>` of the MappingProjections involved.  This
requires that a set of `target values <Run_Targets>` be provided (along with the **inputs**) in the **targets**
argument of the Process' `execute <Process.execute>` or `run <Process.run>` method, one for each `learning
sequence <Process_Learning_Sequence>`. These are used to calculate a `learning_signal
<LearningMechanism.learning_signal>` for each MappingProjection in a learning sequence. This is conveyed by a
`LearningProjection` as a `weight_change_matrix <LearningProjection.weight_change_matrix>` to the MappingProjection's
*MATRIX* `ParameterPort <Mapping_Matrix_ParameterPort>`, that  is used to modify the MappingProjection's `matrix
<MappingProjection.matrix>` parameter when it executes.

.. note::
   The changes to a Projection induced by learning are not applied until the Mechanisms that receive those
   projections are next executed (see :ref:`Lazy Evaluation <LINK>` for an explanation of "lazy" updating).

The `learning_signal <LearningMechanism>`\\s for a learning sequence are calculated, for each sequence, so as to reduce
the difference between the value received by the *TARGET* Mechanism in its *SAMPLE* `InputPort
<ComparatorMechanism_Structure>` (see `above <Process_Learning_Sequence>`) and the target value for the sequence
specified in the corresponding item of the **target** argument of the Process' `execute <Process.execute>` or
`run <Process.run>` method.


.. _Process_Examples:

Examples
--------

*Specification of Mechanisms in a pathway:*  The first Mechanism in the example below is specified as a reference to an
instance, the second as a default instance of a Mechanism type, and the third in `MechanismTuple format
<Process_Mechanism_Specification>`, specifying a reference to a Mechanism that should receive my_params at runtime::

    mechanism_1 = TransferMechanism()
    mechanism_2 = DDM()
    some_params = {PARAMETER_PORT_PARAMS:{THRESHOLD:2,NOISE:0.1}}
    my_process = Process(pathway=[mechanism_1, TransferMechanism, (mechanism_2, my_params)])

*Default Projection specification:*  The `pathway` for this Process uses default Projection specifications; as a
result, a `MappingProjection` is automatically instantiated between each of the Mechanisms listed::

    my_process = Process(pathway=[mechanism_1, mechanism_2, mechanism_3])


*Inline Projection specification using an existing Projection:*  In this `pathway <Process.pathway>`,
``projection_A`` is specified as the Projection between the first and second Mechanisms; a default Projection is
created between ``mechanism_2`` and ``mechanism_3``::

    projection_A = MappingProjection()
    my_process = Process(pathway=[mechanism_1, projection_A, mechanism_2, mechanism_3])

*Inline Projection specification using a keyword:*  In this `pathway <Process.pathway>`, a
`RANDOM_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX` is used to specify the Projection between the first and second Mechanisms::

    my_process = Process(pathway=[mechanism_1, RANDOM_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX, mechanism_2, mechanism_3])

*Stand-alone Projection specification:*  In this `pathway <Process.pathway>`, ``projection_A`` is explicitly
specified as a Projection between ``mechanism_1`` and ``mechanism_2``, and so is used as the Projection between them
in ``my_process``; a default Projection is created between ``mechanism_2`` and ``mechanism_3``::

    projection_A = MappingProjection(sender=mechanism_1, receiver=mechanism_2)
    my_process = Process(pathway=[mechanism_1, mechanism_2, mechanism_3])

*Process that implements learning:*  This `pathway <Process.pathway>` implements a series of Mechanisms with
Projections between them, all of which will be learned using `BackPropagation` (the default learning algorithm).
Note that it uses the `Logistic` function, which is compatible with BackPropagation::

    mechanism_1 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_2 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_3 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    my_process = Process(pathway=[mechanism_1, mechanism_2, mechanism_3],
                         learning=ENABLED,
                         target=[0])

*Process with individual Projections that implement learning:* This `pathway <Process.pathway>` implements learning
for two MappingProjections (between ``mechanism_1`` and ``mechanism_2``, and ``mechanism_3`` and ``mechanism_4``).
Since they are not contiguous, two `learning sequences <Process_Learning_Sequence>` are created, with `TARGET`
Mechanisms assigned to ``mechanism_2`` and ``mechanism_4`` (that will be listed in ``my_process.target_nodes``)::

    mechanism_1 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_2 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_3 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    mechanism_4 = TransferMechanism(function=Logistic)
    my_process = Process(pathway=[mechanism_1,
                                  MappingProjection(matrix=(RANDOM_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX, LEARNING),
                                  mechanism_2,
                                  mechanism_3,
                                  MappingProjection(matrix=(RANDOM_CONNECTIVITY_MATRIX, LEARNING)),
                                  mechanism_4])


.. _Process_Footnotes:

Footnotes
---------

*lineal*:  this term is used rather than "linear" to refer to the flow of processing -- i.e., the graph structure
of the Process -- rather than the (potentially non-linear) processing characteristics of its individual Components.

    COMMENT:
        Description
        -----------
            Process is a Category of the Component class.
            It implements a Process that is used to execute a sequence of Mechanisms connected by projections.
            NOTES:
                * if no pathway is provided:
                    no mechanism is used
                * the input to the Process is assigned as the input to its ORIGIN Mechanism
                * the output of the Process is taken as the value of the primary OutputPort of its TERMINAL Mechanism

        Class attributes
        ----------------

        className : str : default kwProcessFunctionCategory
        suffix : str : default "<kwMechanismFunctionCategory>"

        Class methods
        -------------
            - execute(input, control_signal_allocations):
                executes the Process by calling execute_functions of the Mechanisms (in order) in the pathway list
                assigns input to sender.output (and passed through mapping) of first Mechanism in the pathway list
                assigns output of last Mechanism in the pathway list to self.output
            - register_process(): registers Process with ProcessRegistry
            [TBI: - adjust(control_signal_allocations=NotImplemented):
                modifies the control_signal_allocations while the Process is executing;
                calling it without control_signal_allocations functions like interrogate
                returns (responseState, accuracy)
            [TBI: - interrogate(): returns (responseState, accuracy)
            [TBI: - terminate(): terminates the Process and returns output
            [TBI: - accuracy(target):
                a function that uses target together with the pathway's output.value(s)
                and its accuracyFunction to return an accuracy measure;
                the target must be in a pathway-appropriate format (checked with call)

        ProcessRegistry
        ---------------
            All Processes are registered in ProcessRegistry, which maintains a dict for the subclass,
              a count for all instances of it, and a dictionary of those instances
    COMMENT

    Attributes
    ----------

    componentType : "Process"

    pathway : List[ProcessingMechanism, MappingProjection, ProcessingMechanism...]
        the `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` and `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` between them that
        are executed in the order listed when the Process `executes <Process_Execution>`.

    process_input_ports : List[ProcessInputPort]
        represent the input to the Process when it is executed.  Each `ProcessInputPort <ProcessInputPort>` represents
        an item of the `input <Process.base>` to a corresponding `InputPort` of the Process' `origin_mechanism
        <Process.origin_mechanism>` (see `Process_Input_And_Output` for details).

    input :  List[value] or ndarray
        input to the Process for each `TRIAL` of execution;  it is assigned the value of the **input** argument
        in a call to the Process' `execute <Process.execute>`  or `run <Process.run>` method. Each of its
        items is assigned as the `value <InputPort.value>` of the corresponding `ProcessInputPort <ProcessInputPort>`
        in `process_input_ports`, and each must match the format of the corresponding item of the `variable
        <Mechanism_Base.variable>` for the Process' `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>`
        (see `Process_Input_And_Output` for details).

        .. note::
            The `input <Process.input>` attribute of a Process preserves its value throughout the execution of the
            Process. It's value is assigned to the `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute of the
            `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` at the start of execution.  After that, by default, that
            Mechanism's `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute is zeroed. This is so that if the
            `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` is executed again in the same `TRIAL` of execution
            (e.g., if it is part of a recurrent loop) it does not continue to receive the initial input to the
            Process.  However, this behavior can be modified with the Process' `clamp_input <Process.clamp_input>`
            attribute.

    COMMENT
        input_value :  2d np.array : default ``defaults.variable``
            same as the `variable <Process.variable>` attribute of the Process; contains the `value
            <InputPort.value>` of each ProcessInputPort in its `process_input_ports` attribute.
    COMMENT

    clamp_input : Optional[keyword]
        determines whether the Process' `input <Process.input>` continues to be applied to the `origin_mechanism
        <Process.origin_mechanism>` if it is executed again within the same `TRIAL`.  It can take the following
        values:

        * `None`: applies the Process' `input <Process.input>` to the `origin_mechanism
          <Process.origin_mechanism>` only once (the first time it is executed) in a given `TRIAL` of execution.

        * `SOFT_CLAMP`: combines the Process' `input <Process.input>` with input from any other Projections to the
          `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` every time the latter is executed within a `TRIAL` of
          execution.

        * `HARD_CLAMP`: applies the Process' `input <Process.input>` to the `origin_mechanism
          <Process.origin_mechanism>` to the exclusion of any other source(s) of input every time the Process is
          executed.

    initial_values : Dict[ProcessingMechanism, param value]
        values used to initialize ProcessingMechanisms designated as `INITIALIZE_CYCLE` whenever the Process'
        `initialize <Process.initialize>` method is called. The key for each entry is a ProcessingMechanism, and
        the value is a number, list or np.array that is assigned to that Mechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>`
        attribute whenever it is initialized. `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` that are designated as
        `INITIALIZE_CYCLE` but not included in the **initial_values** specification are initialized with the value of
        their `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute (i.e., the default input for that Mechanism).

    value: 2d np.array
        same as the `value <OutputPort.value>` of the `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` of
        `terminal_mechanism <Process.terminal_mechanism>`.

    output_port : Port
        the `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` of `terminal_mechanism <Process.terminal_mechanism>`.

    output : list
        same as the `output_values <Mechanism_Base.output_values>` attribute of `terminal_mechanism
        <Process.terminal_mechanism>`.

    COMMENT

    COMMENT
    ..  origin_mechanisms : MechanismList
            a list with the `ORIGIN` Mechanism of the Process.

            .. note:: A Process can have only one `ORIGIN` Mechanism; the use of a list is for compatibility with

      .. _phaseSpecMax : int : default 0
             phase of last (set of) ProcessingMechanism(s) to be executed in the Process.
             It is assigned to the ``phaseSpec`` for the Mechanism in the pathway with the largest ``phaseSpec`` value.

      .. numPhases : int : default 1
            the number of :ref:`phases <System_Execution_Phase>` for the Process.

            It is assigned as ``_phaseSpecMax + 1``.
        COMMENT

      .. _isControllerProcess : bool : :keyword:`False`
             identifies whether the Process is an internal one created by a ControlMechanism.

    learning : Optional[LearningProjection]
        indicates whether the Process is configured for learning.  If it has a value other than `None`, then `learning
        has been configured <Process_Learning_Specification>` for one or more `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>`
        in the Process;  if it is `None`, none of MappingProjections in the Process has been configured for learning.

        .. note::
           The `learning <Process.learning>` attribute of a Process may have a value other than `None` even
           if no assignment is made to the **learning** argument of the `process` command;  this occurs if one or more
           MappingProjections in the Process are `specified individually for learning
           <Process_Learning_Specification>`.

        COMMENT:
        .. note::  If an existing `LearningProjection` or a call to the constructor is used for the specification,
                   the object itself will **not** be used as the LearningProjection for the Process. Rather it
                   will be used as a template (including any parameters that are specified) for creating
                   LearningProjections for all of the `MappingProjections <MappingProjection>` in the Process.

                   .. _learning_enabled : bool
                      indicates whether or not learning is enabled.  This only has effect if the ``learning`` parameter
                      has been specified (see above).
        COMMENT

    learning_rate : float : default None
        determines the `learning_rate <LearningMechanism.learning_rate>` used for `MappingProjections
        <MappingProjection>` `specified for learning <Process_Learning_Sequence>` in the Process that do not have their
        `learning_rate <LearningProjection.learning_rate>` otherwise specified.   If is `None`, and the Process is
        executed as part of a `System`, and the System has a `learning_rate <System.learning_rate>` specified,
        then that is the value used.  Otherwise, the default value of the :keyword:`learning_rate` parameter for the
        `function <LearningMechanism.function>` of the `LearningMechanism associated with each MappingProjection
        <Process_Learning_Sequence>` is used.  If a :keyword:`learning_rate` is specified for the `LearningSignal
        <LearningSignal_Learning_Rate>` or `LearningProjection <LearningProjection_Function_and_Learning_Rate>`
        associated with a MappingProjection, that is applied in addition to any specified for the Process or the
        relevant LearningMechanism.

    results : List[OutputPort.value]
        the return values from a sequence of executions of the Process;  its value is `None` if the Process has not
        been executed.

    name : str
        the name of the Process; if it is not specified in the **name** argument of the constructor, a
        default is assigned by ProcessRegistry (see `Naming` for conventions used for default and duplicate names).

    prefs : PreferenceSet or specification dict
        the `PreferenceSet` for the Process; if it is not specified in the **prefs** argument of the
        constructor, a default is assigned using `classPreferences` defined in __init__.py (see :doc:`PreferenceSet
        <LINK>` for details).

            for the corresponding `ComparatorMechanism` in `target_nodes <Process.target_nodes>`.

        params : Dict[param keyword: param value] :  default None
            a `parameter dictionary <ParameterPort_Specification>` that can include any of the parameters used
            as arguments to instantiate the object. Use parameter's name as the keyword for its entry.  Values specified

        Returns
        -------

        output of Process : ndarray
            the `value <OutputPort.value>` of the `primary OutputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` of the
            `terminal_mechanism <Process.terminal_mechanism>` of the Process.

        Arguments
        ---------

        inputs : List[input] or ndarray(input) : default default_variable for a single execution
            specifies the input used to `execute <Process_Execution>` the Process for each `TRIAL` in a sequence of
            executions  (see `Run` for formatting requirements and options). Each item of the outermost level (if a
            nested list) or axis 0 (if an ndarray) is assigned as the `input <Process.input>` to the Process for the
            corresponding `TRIAL`, and therefore must be compatible (in number and type of items) with the `variable
            <Mechanism_Base.variable>` of the `origin_mechanism <Process.origin_mechanism>` for the Process. If the
            number of items is less than **num_trials**, the **inputs** are cycled until the number of `TRIALS`\\s
            specified in **num_trials** has been executed.

        num_trials : int : default None
            number of `TRIAL`\\s to execute.  If the number exceeds the number of **inputs** specified, they are cycled
            until the number of `TRIALS`\\s specified in **num_trials** has been executed.

        initialize : bool default False
            specifies whether to call the Process` `initialize <Process.initialize>` method before executing
            each `TRIAL`;  if it is `False`, then `initialize <Process.initialize>` is called only *once*,
            before the first `TRIAL` executed.

        initial_values : ProcessingMechanism, List[input] or np.ndarray(input)] : default None
            specifies the values used to initialize `ProcessingMechanisms <ProcessingMechanism>` designated as
            `INITIALIZE_CYCLE` whenever the Process' `initialize <Process.initialize>` method is called. The key
            for each entry must be a ProcessingMechanism `designated <Process_Mechanism_Initialize_Cycle>`
            `INITIALIZE_CYCLE`, and the value must be a number, list or np.array that is compatible with the format
            of the ProcessingMechanism's `value <Mechanism_Base.value>` attribute. ProcessingMechanisms designated as
            `INITIALIZE_CYCLE` but not specified in **initial_values** are initialized with the value of their
            `variable <Mechanism_Base.variable>` attribute (the default input for that Mechanism).

        targets : List[input] or np.ndarray(input) : default None
