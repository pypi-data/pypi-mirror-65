Overview

This module contains functions that automatically construct and compose the components necessary for learning
when this is specified for a process.

COMMENT:
    IMPLEMENT: LearningMechanism:
        PROCESS & SYSTEM:
          • Convert ProcessInputPort and SystemInputPort into Mechanisms with LinearFunction IDENTITY_FUNCTION
          • Use only one ObjectiveMechanism for all levels with the following args:
                default_variable[[ACTIVITY][ERROR]]
                monitored_output_ports: [[error_mech.OutputPort][error_mech.objective_mechanism.OutputPort]]
                names: [[ACTIVITY][ERROR]]
                function:  ErrorDerivative(variable, derivative)
                               variable[0] = activity
                               variable[1] = error_signal from error_mech ObjectiveMechanism (target for TERMINAL)
                               derivative = error_derivative (1 for TERMINAL)
                role:LEARNING
          • Use only one LearningMechanism with the following args:
                variable[[ACTIVATION_INPUT_INDEX][ACTIVATION_OUTPUT_INDEX][ERROR_SIGNAL_INDEX]
                activation_derivative
                error_matrix
                function
            Initialize and assign args with the following WIZZARD:
        WIZZARD:
            Needs to know
                activation_mech_output (Mechanism)
                    activation_derivative (function)
                error_mech (Mechanism)
                    error_derivative (function)
                    error_matrix (ndarray) - for MappingProjection from activation_mech_output to error_mech
            ObjectiveMechanism:
                Initialize variable:
                      use error_mech.outputPort.valuee to initialize variable[ACTIVITY]
                      use outputPort.value of error_mech's objective_mechanism to initialize variable[ERROR]
                Assign mapping projections:
                      nextLevel.outputPort.value -> input_ports[ACTIVITY] of ObjectiveMechanism
                      nextLevel.objective_mechanism.outputPort.value  -> input_ports[ERROR] of ObjectiveMechanism
                NOTE: For `TERMINAL` Mechanism:
                          error_mech is Process or System InputPort (function=Linear, so derivative =1), so that
                             error_mech.outputPort.value is the target, and
                             error_derivative = 1

            LearningMechanism:
                Initialize variable:
                      use mapping_projection.sender.value to initialize variable[ACTIVATION_INPUT_INDEX]
                      use activation_mech_output_outputPort.value to initialize variable[ACTIVATION_OUTPUT_INDEX]
                      use error_mech.objecdtive_mechanism.OutputPort.value to initialize variable[ERROR_SIGNAL_INDEX]
                Assign activation_derivative using function of activation_mech_output of mapping_projection (one being learned)
                Assign error_derivative using function of error_mech
                Assign error_matrix as runtime_param using projection to error_mech [ALT: ADD TO VARIABLE]
                Assign mapping projections:
                      mapping_projection.sender -> input_ports[ACTIVATION_INPUT_INDEX] of LearningMechanism
                      activation_mech_output.outputPort -> input_ports[ACTIVATION_OUTPUT_INDEX] of LearningMechanism
                      error_mech.objective_mechanism.OutputPort.value -> input_ports[ERROR_SIGNAL_INDEX]

            For TARGET MECHANISM:  Matrix is IDENTITY MATRIX??
            For TARGET MECHANISM:  derivative for ObjectiveMechanism IDENTITY FUNCTION

    """Instantiate learning components for a LearningProjection

    Instantiates a LearningMechanism or ObjectiveMechanism as the sender for each learning_projection in a learning
        sequence.  A learning sequence is defined as a sequence of ProcessingMechanisms, each of which has a
        projection — that has been specified for learning — to the next Mechanism in the sequence.  This method
        instantiates the components required to support learning for those projections (most importantly,
        the LearningMechanism that provide them with the learning_signal required to modify the matrix of the
        projection, and the ObjectiveMechanism that calculates the error_signal used to generate the learning_signals).


    It instantiates a LearningMechanism or ObjectiveMechanism as the sender for the learning_projection:
    - a LearningMechanism for projections to any ProcessingMechanism that is not the last in the learning sequence;
    - an ObjectiveMechanism for projections to a ProcessingMechanism that is the last in the learning sequence

    Assume that learning_projection's variable and parameters have been specified and validated,
       (which is the case when this method is called from the learning_projection itself in _instantiate_sender()).

    Notes:

    * Once the `receiver` for the learning_projection has been identified, or instantiated:
        - it is thereafter referred to (by reference to it owner) as the `activation_mech_projection`,
            and the Mechanism to which it projects as the `activation_output_mech`;
        - the Mechanism to which it projects is referred referred to as the error_mech (the source of the error_signal).

    * See LearningComponents class for the names of the components of learning used here.

    * This method supports only a single pathway for learning;  that is, the learning sequence must be a linear
        sequence of ProcessingMechanisms.  This is consistent with its implementation at the Process level;
        convergent and divergent pathways for learning can be accomplished through Composition in a
        System.  Accordingly:

            - each LearningMechanism can have only one LearningProjection
            - each ProcessingMechanism can have only one MappingProjection that is subject to learning

      When searching downstream for projections that are being learned (to identify the error_mech Mechanism as a
      source for the LearningMechanism's error_signal), the method uses the first projection that it finds, beginning
      in `primary outputPort <OutputPort_Primary>` of the activation_mech_output, and continues similarly
      in the error_mech.  If any conflicting implementations of learning components are encountered,
      an exception is raised.
