Simulation module
=================

Module to interact easily with the NEST simulator. It allows to:

* build a NEST network from :class:`~nngt.Network` or
  :class:`~nngt.SpatialNetwork` objects,
* monitor the activity of the network (taking neural groups into account)
* plot the activity while separating the behaviours of predefined neural groups
