Overview
--------

Based on `PythonQwt`_ (a pure Python/PyQt reimplementation of the curve 
plotting Qwt C++ library, included in guiqwt base source code) and on the 
scientific modules NumPy and SciPy, ``guiqwt`` is a Python library providing 
efficient 2D data-plotting features (curve/image visualization and related 
tools) for interactive computing and signal/image processing application 
development. It is based on Qt graphical user interfaces library, and 
currently supports both ``PyQt4`` and ``PyQt5``.

Extension to `PythonQwt`_:

* set of tools for curve and image plotting
* GUI-based application development helpers

.. _PythonQwt: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PythonQwt
