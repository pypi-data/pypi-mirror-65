        0.History
        ====================================================================
        
        V1.1.7
        
        Based on user's feedback,
        
        
        
        
        Update for hydraulic Sketcher:
        
         * 1. Fix some path bugs of missing ski.qss file.
        
        
        
        
        Even though, This free package still needs to be optimized in the coming days.
        
        the latest shot of the program UI is shown as follows.

        Project description for pyHydraulic
        ====================================================================
        The software package is to realize the visualization of the digital
        hydraulic oil circuit in the software interface. In the software,
        through this software package, we can easily connect
        the hydraulic components and sensors in the oil circuit diagram.
        It can help people to understand, diagnose and even predict the
        faults in the hydraulic system.
        It's a bit like a digital twin,
        but it's only two-dimensional.
        
        
        
        I specially built a tool called "hydraulic Sketcher" for drawing oil diagram, which is included in this package. Similar to Visio, it can draw the hydraulic schematic diagram simply.
        
        Create social share component pyHydraulic based on `github <https://github.com/nanjing-institute-of-technology/pyHydraulic>`_
        
        *************
        1.Get started
        *************
        
        Installation is easy::
        
         $ pip install pyHydraulic
        
        ****************************************************
        2.Run the hydraulic Sketcher to draw schematics
        ****************************************************
        
        Hydraulic sketcher is a tool similar to visio.It has been integrated
        in this package. Type the following code to call the tool independently.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from pyHydraulic.hydraulicSketcher import hydraulicSketcher
        
            hydraulicSketcher.run()
        
        Next, you'll see the following software interface.

        The tool itself is also based on the pyHydraulic package. However, there are still some functions to be improved. A tutorial on using the tool will be provided later in GitHub.
        
        *************
        3.Example
        *************
        
        In the coming days, I will give the instruction documents to give you some instructions on how to draw
        the hydraulic schematic diagram and load it in the interface of the measurement and
        control system For more demonstrations, please click the website below.
