        Altimeter is a system to graph and scan AWS resources across multiple
        AWS Organizations and Accounts.
        
        Altimeter generates RDF files which can be loaded into a triplestore
        such as AWS Neptune for querying.
        
        # Quickstart
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install altimeter
        
        ## Generating the Graph
        
        Assuming you have configured AWS CLI credentials
        (see <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html>),
        run:
        
            altimeter --base_dir /tmp/altimeter --regions us-east-1
        
        This will scan all resources in the *us-east-1* region. Multiple regions
        can be specified in this argument or it can be omitted entirely in which
        case all regions will be scanned.
        
        The full path to the generated RDF file will printed, for example:
        
            Created /tmp/altimeter/20191018/1571425383/graph.rdf
        
        This RDF file can then be loaded into a triplestore such as Neptune or
        Blazegraph for querying.
