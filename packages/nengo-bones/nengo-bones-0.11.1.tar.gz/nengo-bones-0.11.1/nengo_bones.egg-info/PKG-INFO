        Nengo Bones
        ***********
        
        The aim of this project is to automate the configuration of repositories
        throughout the Nengo ecosystem.  The idea is that we can centralize the
        design and maintenance of "meta" project code (such as CI testing
        infrastructure) in this project, rather than each repository maintaining that
        code independently.
        
        The basic methodology for this project is a templating system in which
        there are common templates for meta files that are populated with
        data in each downstream project.  Projects control this templating through the
        ``.nengobones.yml`` configuration file, which defines the information used to
        fill in the templates.
        
        Wherever possible, we try to do this templating in such a way that downstream
        projects will be automatically updated when an update is made in
        ``nengo-bones``. However, some files cannot be updated automatically and
        require downstream repos to manually run a script to update those files.
        
        Note that this repository itself is configured using the ``nengo-bones``
        templating system, so if you would like an example of how to use it, check out
        `the source code <https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones>`__.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        We recommend installing ``nengo-bones`` using ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install nengo-bones
        
        Or for the latest updates you can perform a developer installation:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones.git
            pip install -e ./nengo-bones
        
        Basic usage
        ===========
        
        The first step is to fill in the ``.nengobones.yml`` configuration file.  You
        can use the one in this repository as a starting point, or see
        `the documentation
        <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-bones/examples/configuration.html>`__
        for more details.  This file should be
        placed in the top level of your project.
        
        All of the manually generated template files can then be rendered by running
        this command in the same folder as the ``.nengobones.yml`` file:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            bones-generate
        
        See ``bones-generate --help`` or
        `the documentation <https://www.nengo.ai/nengo-bones/cli.html>`__
        for a full list of command line options.

        =======================
        
        **Changed**

          repos. (`#97`_)
        
        .. _#97: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/97

        **Changed**
        
        - Docs script will now use ``nengo_sphinx_theme.ext.backoff``, which adds

        ========================
        
        **Changed**
        
        - The ``bones-check`` that TravisCI does now prints diffs for easier
          debugging. (`#80`_)
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - Fixed an issue with the ``.travis.yml`` template caused by the new

        0.7.3 (January 8, 2020)
        =======================
        
        **Removed**
        
        - Removed coverage.py early starting logic. This is no longer necessary as of Nengo
          3.0 and causes problems with the new coverage.py 5.0 release. (`#78`_)
        
        .. _#78: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/78
        
        0.7.2 (December 2, 2019)
        ========================
        
        **Changed**
        
        - Failing to install miniconda in ``remote.sh`` is no longer considered a build
          error (this can occur, for example, when rerunning a build that already has
          miniconda installed). (`#71`_)
        
        .. _#71: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/71
        
        0.7.1 (November 14, 2019)
        =========================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added support for ``nengo_sphinx_theme.ext.redirects``, which can be used to
          automatically add redirects for renamed documentation pages. (`#68`_)
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - Added locking to ``remote.sh`` script to avoid possible race conditions
          during cleanup. (`#69`_)
        
        .. _#68: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/68
        .. _#69: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/69
        
        0.7.0 (November 7, 2019)
        ========================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added support for ``sphinx.ext.doctest``, which can be used to automatically
          test code snippets in docstrings. (`#67`_)
        
        **Changed**
        
        - Updated the ``black`` version used in ``pre-commit`` hooks. (`#67`_)
        
        .. _#67: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/67
        
        0.6.0 (October 30, 2019)
        ========================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added a ``remote.sh`` CI script template for remotely executing
          commands on an SSH-accessible machine. (`#65`_)
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - Fixed a crash when a file contained the text "Automatically generated
          by nengo-bones", but was not present in the config file. (`#61`_, `#66`_)

        =========================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added ``nengo_simulator``, ``nengo_simloader`` and ``nengo_neurons``
          options to the ``pytest`` section of the ``setup.cfg`` template to
          support testing changes in Nengo 3.0. (`#58`_)
        
        **Changed**
        
        - The default value for ``pytest.addopts`` in ``setup.cfg`` has been removed
          because Nengo 3.0 does not require ``-p nengo.tests.options``. (`#58`_)
        
        .. _#58: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/58
        
        0.4.2 (August 8, 2019)
        ======================
        
        **Added**

          ``setup.cfg`` template to set pruning patterns for pytest-plt. (`#52`_)
        - Added ``rng_salt`` option to the ``pytest`` section of the ``setup.cfg``
          template to set the salt for pytest-rng. (`#55`_)
        
        .. _#52: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/52
        .. _#55: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/55
        
        0.4.1 (July 26, 2019)

        **Added**
        
        - Added ``allclose_tolerances`` option to the ``pytest`` section of the
          ``setup.cfg`` template to set tolerances for pytest-allclose. (`#47`_)
        
        .. _#47: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/47
        
        0.4.0 (July 26, 2019)
        =====================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added style guide and release instructions to documentation. (`#44`_)
        - Added templates for ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` and ``pyproject.toml``
          so downstream repositories can easily adopt Black. (`#49`_)
        
        **Changed**
        
        - We now check that Python source files are autoformatted with Black
          in the ``static.sh`` script. (`#49`_)
        - Templates will now be autoformatted with Black during the rendering
          process, if Black is installed. (`#49`_)
        - Take advantage of multiprocessing to speed up pylint static checks. (`#49`_)
        - The ``E203`` flake8 check and ``bad-continuation`` pylint check are now
          disabled by default. (`#50`_)
        
        .. _#44: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/44
        .. _#49: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/49
        .. _#50: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/50
        
        0.3.0 (July 19, 2019)
        =====================
        
        **Added**
        
        - The ``nengo_bones.templates`` module was added to consolidate code
          that loads and renders templates. (`#45`_)
        
        **Changed**
        
        - The ``docs/conf.py`` template has been updated for new versions of
          Nengo Sphinx Theme. (`#46`_)
        - ``static.sh`` and ``examples.sh`` will now check any notebooks in the
          ``docs`` folder (not just ``docs/examples``). (`#46`_)
        - ``bones-check`` now checks that the content of the generated files
          matches the expected content, rather than relying on version numbers.
          This means most files will not need to be regenerated when new Nengo Bones
          versions are released, and that ``bones-check`` will be sensitive to changes
          within a dev version. (`#45`_)
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - The ``static.sh``/``examples.sh`` script will no longer fail if there are no
          notebooks in the ``docs`` folder. (`#46`_)
        
        .. _#45: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/45
        .. _#46: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/46
        
        0.2.1 (May 24, 2019)
        ====================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added ``codespell_ignore_words`` option to ``static.sh.template``,
          which is a list of words that ``codespell`` will ignore. (`#35`_)
        - Added ``analytics_id`` option to ``docs_conf.py.template``,
          which will enable Google Analytics tracking. (`#35`_)
        
        **Changed**
        
        - ``codespell`` will now ignore ``_vendor`` directories. (`#36`_)
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - Fixed an issue with ``static.sh.template`` in which Python files
          that were not converted from notebooks were deleted. (`#16`_)
        
        .. _#16: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/16
        .. _#35: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/35
        .. _#36: https://github.com/nengo/nengo-bones/pull/36
        
        0.2.0 (May 15, 2019)
        ====================
        
        **Added**
        
        - Added ``apt_install`` option that can be set in the ``jobs`` section to
          ``apt install`` any custom ``apt`` requirements for a job. (`#14`_)
        - Added templates for ``CONTRIBUTING.rst``, ``CONTRIBUTORS.rst``,
          ``LICENSE.rst``, ``MANIFEST.in``, ``docs/conf.py``, ``setup.cfg``, and
          ``setup.py`` (`#17`_)
        - Templates will now be automatically loaded from a ``<repo>/.templates``
          directory if it exists. When overriding existing templates, the built-in
          templates can be accessed in ``include`` and ``extend`` tags with the
          ``templates/`` prefix. (`#17`_)
        - Added ``flake8`` to the static check script. (`#17`_)
        - Added the ``bones-pr-number`` script to predict the next PR number for a
          repository. This helps when writing a changelog entry before a PR has been
          made. (`#18`_)
        
        **Changed**
        
        - The Python version is now specified by the ``python`` option (instead of
          ``python_version``), for consistency with ``.travis.yml``. (`#14`_)
        - All ``nengo-bones`` scripts now start with ``bones-``, to make them easier
          to find with autocompletion. ``generate-bones`` is now ``bones-generate``,
          and ``check-bones`` is now ``bones-check``. (`#18`_)
        
        **Removed**
        
        - Removed ``conda`` from the CI setup; all installations should be done
          through ``pip`` instead. (`#14`_)
        - Removed the ``--template-dir`` option from the ``generate-bones`` script;
          use a ``.templates`` directory instead. (`#17`_)
        
        **Fixed**
        
        - Order of templated dicts should now be deterministic for
          all Python versions. (`#14`_)
