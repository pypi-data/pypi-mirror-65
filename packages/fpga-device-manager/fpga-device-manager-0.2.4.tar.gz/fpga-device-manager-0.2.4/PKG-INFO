Description: # FPGA Device Manager
        A GUI for managing device configurations for a Smart Home FPGA solution that was created as part of a Bachelor's thesis.
        
        This application aids you in creating a device configuration for a Smart Home FPGA and automatically generates the corresponding Verilog code.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install fpga-device-manager
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        To launch the GUI, execute:
        ```
        python -m fpga_device_manager
        ```
        
        - The generated Verilog `.v` files will have to be copied manually to the `smarthome/source/generated` folder of the Lattice Diamond project.
        - The generated `smarthome.ldf` file has to be copied manually to the root folder of the Lattice Diamond project.
        
        ### Command-line generation
        Verilog code can be generated from the command line like this:
        ```
        python -m fpga_device_manager.generator --output=./generated configuration.json
        ```
        
        ## Valid configurations
        A valid configuration needs:
        
        - at least one appliance
        - at least one sensor
        - every sensor to be associated with an appliance
