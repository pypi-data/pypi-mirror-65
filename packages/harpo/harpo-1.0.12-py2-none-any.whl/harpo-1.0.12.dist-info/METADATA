Harpo
=====
-----------
Description
-----------

    Harpocrates (Ancient Greek: Ἁρποκράτης) was the god of silence, secrets and confidentiality.

**Harpo** is GPG-based secret storage/sharing library.

It is aims to be a convenient wrapper around GPG and tries to solve the following problems:

* Storing secrets in a repository in a secure manner
* Providing a group-based access to the stored secrets
* Providing an easy way to re-encrypt secrets

It was inspired by `blackbox <https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox>`_ by StackExchange.




-----------
Quick Start
-----------

Initialize
==========

Initialize harpo in a current directory:

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo system init

This will create :code:`.harpo` directory that will contain your secrets and all required metadata.



Create Domain
=============

Domain — is a 'directory' for secrets. To be honest, it `is` a directory that contains GPG-encrypted files, plus some metadata.

Let's create one and name it :code:`secrets`:

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo domain create secrets



Create User
===========

User is a Harpo's word for 'recipient'. A User must have a GPG key attached to it so that Harpo will use it then
to encrypt secrets.

The process of adding a user consists of two steps: add a key, create a user associated with this key:

1. add a key
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide assumes that you already have your GPG key in your default keyring.
Let's export your GPG public key and add it to Harpo:

..  code-block:: bash

    gpg --export --armor your-key-fingerprint | harpo key create -

2. create a user
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command will create a user named :code:`alice` associated with your GPG public key:

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo user create alice your-key-fingerprint

Let's verify by running :code:`harpo user list`. The output should look like:

..  code-block::

    +--------+------------------------------------------+
    | name   | key_fingerprint                          |
    |--------+------------------------------------------|
    | alice  | A8EE4ED8DDFC3EFFD26EC0042477DBC294CF0AF0 |
    +--------+------------------------------------------+


Create Group (optional)
=======================

While you can skip this step if you have just one or two users, it's just a lot more convenient to organize your users into groups if you have many of them.

Let's create a group and add Alice to it:

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo group create admins
    harpo group include-user admins alice

You can verify with :code:`harpo group list`:

..  code-block::

    +--------+-----------+
    | name   | members   |
    |--------+-----------|
    | admins | ['alice'] |
    +--------+-----------+



Grant access to Domain
======================

Now we have to tell Harpo that our user/group should be able to manage secrets in Domain :code:`secrets`:

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo domain allow secrets %admins

Note the :code:`%` character! Just like in sudoers, this character tells the program to treat :code:`admins` as a group.

**OR**

If you want to grant access just to a **user**, not a group:

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo domain allow secrets alice

You can verify this with :code:`harpo domain info secrets`:

..  code-block::

    +---------+----------+-------------+--------+----------------------+-----------+--------------+
    | name    | parent   | allow       | deny   | inherit_recipients   | comment   | recipients   |
    |---------+----------+-------------+--------+----------------------+-----------+--------------|
    | secrets | None     | ['%admins'] | []     | True                 | None      | ['alice']    |
    +---------+----------+-------------+--------+----------------------+-----------+--------------+

In column :code:`allow` you can see users and groups that have access to this domain.

In column recipients you can see a final set of recipients for this domain.
These users will be the recipients of a GPG-encrypted secret that Harpo will create.



Create a secret
===============

Finally we can encrypt something.

You have two slightly different ways of creating a secret using Harpo CLI. Let's go through them:

1. pass secret value as an argument
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    harpo secret create [OPTIONS] DOMAIN_NAME SECRET_NAME SECRET_VALUE

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo secret create secrets foo bar


2. interactive editor (beta)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You also have an option to launch your favorite editor!

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo secret edit secrets foo

**VIM users**: There is a known issue with vim when backup files are enabled - Harpo won't save your edits at all.
You can disable backup files with :code:`nobackup` directive.


Read a secret
=============

This is pretty straightforward:

..  code-block:: bash

    harpo secret read secrets foo

Documentation

Domain
======

Domain — is a logical group of secrets. You can think of domain as a directory that contains secrets and other domains.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

Domains have following properties:

* **name** — the name of a Domain
* **children** — each Domain can have any number of subdomains, i.e. children.
  By default all permissions are inherited from the parent to children.
  This property is not stored in metadata but instead populated in runtime.
* **parent** — Every Domain has a parent except the root (top level) Domains. Root Domains has no parents.
* **allow** — list of Groups and Users that have access to this Domain.
* **deny** — list of Groups and Users that are explicitly denied to become a recipients for secrets in this Domain.
* **recipients** — a set of Users that are derived from the list of :code:`(allow - deny)` that have access to this Domain.
  This property is not stored in metadata but instead populated in runtime.
* **inherit_recipients** — controls how a given Domain should inherit recipients from its parent.
  Currently only two modes are available: True and False. Inheritance can be disabled during Domain creation from CLI
  by adding :code:`--no-inherit-recipients` flag.

Storage & metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Domains are mapped to filesystem as directories and can be found in :code:`.harpo/data`.

Every Domain also has an associated metadata in :code:`.harpo/meta/domain.json`.


Key
===

Key is one of the simplest entities in Harpo. It's just that: a GPG public key that is stored in the Harpo's keyring.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

* **fingerprint** — GPG key fingerprint; the main property of a Key

Storage & metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Harpo's keyring can be found in :code:`.harpo/keystore/pubring.gpg`.

Keys don't use any metadata.


User
====

In Harpo prior 1.0 users were represented by GPG keys only. Harpo 1.0 adds a new separate entity for users.

This being said, Users are still mapped to Keys as 1-to-1, but this probably will change in the future
(allowing a single User to have multiple GPG keys, for example).

Currently User is just a named mapping to a Key.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

* **name** — the name of a User
* **key_fingerprint** — a GPG key fingerprint of a key that is associated with this User.

Storage & metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users metadata can be found in :code:`.harpo/meta/user.json`


Group
=====

Group — is a set of Users. Currently groups can't contain other groups.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

* **name** — the name of a Group
* **members** — list of members

Storage & metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Groups metadata can be found in :code:`.harpo/meta/group.json`


Secret
======

Secret — is a GPG-encrypted data inside Domain.

To encrypt a secret Harpo needs to know the list of recipients.
Harpo gets this information form Domain that holds this secret.

With one notable exception...

**Shared Secrets** are secrets with the name that ends with :code:`.shared`.

Secrets like this are special in a way that they are encrypted with not only with keys
belonging to recipients of a Domain that holds these secrets, but also with keys of recipients from this Domain's subdomains
and other Domains from the same level of hierarchy.

This requires an example.

An example
~~~~~~~~~~

Let's say we have the following Domain hierarchy:

..  code-block::

    secrets    (allow: alice)
    ├── bar
    │   ├── quux    (bob)  --no-inherit-recipients
    │   │   └── credit-cards
    │   └── secret.shared
    └── baz    (jane)
        └── passwords

* secrets — root Domain
* bar — a child Domain of :code:`bar`; it has a Secret called :code:`secret.shared`
* quux — a child Domain of :code:`quux`; it has a Secret called :code:`credit-cards`;
  it was created with :code:`--no-inherit-recipients`
* baz — another child Domain of :code:`secrets`; it has a Secret called :code:`passwords`
* allowed users are specified inside parenthesis


**Q**: So, who will be able to decrypt :code:`secret.shared`?

**A**: Alice, Bob and Jane. All three Users will be able to decrypt it because it's a shared Secret.
Harpo will use the following keys to encrypt it:

* Alice — because she has access to the root domain and :code:`bar` inherits recipients from its parent
* Bob — because shared secrets are encrypted with keys from subdomains
* Jane — because shared secrets must be encrypted with keys from the same level of hierarchy (bar and baz are on the same level)

**Q**: OK, how about :code:`passwords`?

**A**: Alice and Jane. Bob has no access to this secret because it's not shared
and he only has access to his own subdomain :code:`quux`

**Q**: And :code:`credit-cards`?

**A**: Only Bob has access to this secret. Even though Alice has access to the root domain :code:`secrets`,
Harpo won't use her key to encrpypt :code:`credit-cards` because :code:`quux` doesn't inherit recipients.

Properties
~~~~~~~~~~

Secrets don't demonstrate any interesting properties, really.

* **name** — name of a Secret

Storage & Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Secrets are stored as GPG encrypted files in :code:`.harpo/data/<domain_name>/<secret_name>`.
