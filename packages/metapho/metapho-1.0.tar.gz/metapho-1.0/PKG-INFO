Description: metapho
        =======
        
        A keyboard-driven app for tagging and organizing large numbers of photos efficiently.
        
        This arose out of my [Pho](http://shallowsky.com/software/pho/)
        image viewer ([Pho on GitHub](https://github.com/akkana/pho)).
        It started to get unwieldy adding ever more tagging features to what
        was intended as just a fast, light image viewer.
        
        Metapho is intended as a lightweight, flexible way of organizing
        large numbers of photos. It uses text files, not a proprietary database,
        so you're not locked down to one app or a proprietary database,
        and you can view your tags databases at any time, or edit them in a
        text editor if you should ever want to.
        
        Metapho can be driven entirely from the keyboard: you should be able
        to do everything you need without moving your hands to the mouse,
        though you can use the mouse if you find that easier.
        
        It depends on PyGTK, but not on gnome or any other desktop services.
        
        It includes a program called "notags" that you can run to examine
        the current directory recursively and tell you about files and
        directories that still need to be tagged. Run it at the root of
        an image directory that might have untagged subdirectories.
        
        [Metapho is available on PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/metapho/),
        so you can install it as `pip install metapho`.
        
        Read the [Metapho Documentation](https://metapho.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
        for more information on both the app and the API of the classes
        inside it.
