    os-client-config is now a thin shim around openstacksdk. It exists and
    will continue to exist provide backward compatibility.
upgrade:
  - |
    ``get_region_name`` no longer supports pre-service region name overrides.
    An ``os_client_config.cloud_config.CloudConfig`` object represents a region
    of a cloud. The support was originally added for compatibility with the
    similar feature in openstacksdk's ``Profile``. Both the support for
    service regions and the ``Profile`` object have been removed from
    openstacksdk, so there is no need to attempt to add a compatibility layer
    here as there is nothing that has the ability to consume it.
