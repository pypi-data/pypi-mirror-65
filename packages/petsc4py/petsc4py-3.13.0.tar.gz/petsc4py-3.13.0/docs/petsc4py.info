Abstract
========

This document describes petsc4py(1), a Python(2) port to the PETSc(3)
libraries.

PETSc(4) (the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation)
is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel)
solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential
equations.  It employs the MPI(5) standard for all message-passing
communication.

This package provides an important subset of PETSc functionalities and
uses NumPy(6) to efficiently manage input and output of array data.

A `good friend' of petsc4py is:

        * mpi4py(7): Python bindings for MPI(8), the `Message Passing
          Interface'.

Other projects depends on petsc4py:

        * slepc4py(9): Python bindings for SLEPc(10), the `Scalable
          Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations'.

1.1 Overview
============

PETSc(1) is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable
(parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial
differential equations.  It employs the MPI(2) standard for all
message-passing communication.

PETSc is intended for use in large-scale application projects *note
[petsc-efficient]: 5, and several ongoing computational science projects
are built around the PETSc libraries.  With strict attention to
component interoperability, PETSc facilitates the integration of
independently developed application modules, which often most naturally
employ different coding styles and data structures.

PETSc is easy to use for beginners *note [petsc-user-ref]: 6.  Moreover,
its careful design allows advanced users to have detailed control over
the solution process.  PETSc includes an expanding suite of parallel
linear and nonlinear equation solvers that are easily used in
application codes written in C, C++, and Fortran.  PETSc provides many
of the mechanisms needed within parallel application codes, such as
simple parallel matrix and vector assembly routines that allow the
overlap of communication and computation.

1.1.1 Components
----------------

PETSc is designed with an object-oriented style.  Almost all
user-visible types are abstract interfaces with implementations that may
be chosen at runtime.  Those objects are managed through handles to
opaque data structures which are created, accessed and destroyed by
calling appropriate library routines.

PETSc consists of a variety of components.  Each component manipulates a
particular family of objects and the operations one would like to
perform on these objects.  These components provide the functionality
required for many parallel solutions of PDEs.


Vec: Provides the vector operations required for setting up and solving
large-scale linear and nonlinear problems.  Includes easy-to-use
parallel scatter and gather operations, as well as special-purpose code
for handling ghost points for regular data structures.


Mat: A large suite of data structures and code for the manipulation of
parallel sparse matrices.  Includes four different parallel matrix data
structures, each appropriate for a different class of problems.


PC: A collection of sequential and parallel preconditioners, including
(sequential) ILU(k), LU, and (both sequential and parallel) block
Jacobi, overlapping additive Schwarz methods and (through BlockSolve95)
ILU(0) and ICC(0).


KSP: Parallel implementations of many popular Krylov subspace iterative
methods, including GMRES, CG, CGS, Bi-CG-Stab, two variants of TFQMR,
CR, and LSQR. All are coded so that they are immediately usable with any
preconditioners and any matrix data structures, including matrix-free
methods.


SNES: Data-structure-neutral implementations of Newton-like methods for
nonlinear systems.  Includes both line search and trust region
techniques with a single interface.  Employs by default the above data
structures and linear solvers.  Users can set custom monitoring
routines, convergence criteria, etc.


TS: Code for the time evolution of solutions of PDEs.  In addition,
provides pseudo-transient continuation techniques for computing
steady-state solutions.

1.2 Installation
================

* Menu:

* Using pip or easy_install::
* Using distutils::


File: petsc4py.info,  Node: Using pip or easy_install,  Next: Using distutils,  Up: Installation

1.2.1 Using `pip' or `easy_install'
-----------------------------------

You can use ‘pip’ to install ‘petsc4py’ and its dependencies (‘mpi4py’
is optional but highly recommended):

     $ pip install [--user] numpy mpi4py $ pip install [--user] petsc petsc4py

Alternatively, you can use ‘easy_install’ (deprecated):

     $ easy_install petsc4py

If you already have a working PETSc installation, set environment
variables ‘PETSC_DIR’ and ‘PETSC_ARCH’ to appropriate values and next
use ‘pip’:

     $ export PETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc $ export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-opt $ pip install petsc4py

1.2.2.1 Requirements
....................

You need to have the following software properly installed in order to
build `PETSc for Python':

   * Any MPI(1) implementation (2) (e.g., MPICH(3) or Open MPI(4)),
     built with shared libraries.

   * A matching version of PETSc(5) built with shared libraries.

   * NumPy(6) package.

   (2) (1) Unless you have appropiatelly configured and built PETSc
without MPI (configure option ‘--with-mpi=0’).

1.2.2.2 Downloading
...................

The `PETSc for Python' package is available for download at the project
website generously hosted by Bitbucket.  You can use ‘curl’ or ‘wget’ to
get a release tarball.

   * Using ‘curl’:

          $ curl -O https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py/petsc4py-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

   * Using ‘wget’:

          $ wget https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py/petsc4py-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

1.2.2.3 Building
................

After unpacking the release tarball:

     $ tar -zxf petsc4py-X.Y.Z.tar.gz $ cd petsc4py-X.Y.Z

the distribution is ready for building.

     Note: `Mac OS X' users employing a Python distribution built with
     `universal binaries' may need to set the environment variables
     ‘MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET’, ‘SDKROOT’, and ‘ARCHFLAGS’ to
     appropriate values.  As an example, assume your Mac is running
     `Snow Leopard' on a `64-bit Intel' processor and you want to
     override the hard-wired cross-development SDK in Python
     configuration, your environment should be modified like this:

          $ export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 $ export SDKROOT=/ $ export ARCHFLAGS='-arch x86_64'

Some environment configuration is needed to inform the location of
PETSc.  You can set (using ‘setenv’, ‘export’ or what applies to you
shell or system) the environment variables ‘PETSC_DIR’, and ‘PETSC_ARCH’
indicating where you have built/installed PETSc:

     $ export PETSC_DIR=/usr/local/petsc $ export PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-opt

Alternatively, you can edit the file ‘setup.cfg’ and provide the
required information below the ‘[config]’ section:

     [config] petsc_dir  = /usr/local/petsc petsc_arch = arch-linux2-c-opt ...

Finally, you can build the distribution by typing:

     $ python setup.py build

1.2.2.4 Installing
..................

After building, the distribution is ready for installation.

If you have root privileges (either by log-in as the root user of by
using ‘sudo’) and you want to install `PETSc for Python' in your system
for all users, just do:

     $ python setup.py install

The previous steps will install the ‘petsc4py’ package at standard
location ‘`prefix'/lib/python`X'.`Y'/site-packages’.

If you do not have root privileges or you want to install `PETSc for
Python' for your private use, just do:

     $ python setup.py install --user
