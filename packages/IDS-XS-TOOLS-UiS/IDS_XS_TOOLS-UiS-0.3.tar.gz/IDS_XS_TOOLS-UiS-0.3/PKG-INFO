Description: # IDS XS TOOLS - UiS
        Class and functions for processing images and puck objects
        
        ## installation
        
        pip install IDS-XS-TOOLS-UiS
        
        
        
        ## contents
        
        ImageFunctions
            
            Functions to capture image, find pucks and test if image is blurry.
        
        Puck Class
        
            Used to define a Puck object. 
            Happens automatically when a puck is detected using QR-Reader.
            
            Puck class contains:
            puck number
            puck position
            puck angle
            puck height
        
        
        #### function examples;
        
        
        
        **capture_image(cam, gripper_height)**  
        Captures an image and returns image array
        Gripper height is needed.
        
        **findPucks(cam, robot, robtarget_pucks, cam_comp=False)**  
        Finds all pucks in the frame of the camera by capturing an image and scanning the image for QR codes.
        After the codes have been pinpointed, a series of transformations happen to finally create robtargets
        which can be sent to RobotWare.
        Robot, previous found pucks and wether camera compensation has been performed or not is needed.
        
        **set_position(self, position)**  
        Set the [x,y] coordinate belonging  to the puck.
        
        ## example of use
        
            # Two ways to import:
            import ids_xs_tools
            
            # or
            from ids_xs_tools import ImageFunctions, Puck
        
        	# Then again two ways to excecute wanted commands:
        	ids_xs_tools.ImageFunctions.findPucks(config.cam, norbert, robtarget_pucks, 195)
        	
        	# or
        	ImageFunctions.findPucks(config.cam, norbert, robtarget_pucks, 195)
