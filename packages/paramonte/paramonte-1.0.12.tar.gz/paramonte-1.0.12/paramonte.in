! ParaMonte input file for sampling a multivariate 4-dimensional Gaussian distribution as implemented in the accompanying source files.
! USAGE:
! Comments must begin with an exclamation mark (!).
! Comments can appear anywhere on an empty line or, after a value assignment.
! all variable assignments are optional and can be commented out. In such cases, appropriate default values will be assigned.
! Use ParaDRAM namelist (group) name to group a set of ParaDRAM simulation specification variables.
! The order of the input variables in the namelist groups is irrelevant and unimportant.
! Variables can be defined multiple times, but only the last definition will be considered as input.
! All variable names are case insensitive. However, for clarity, this software follows the camelCase code-writing practice.
! String values must be enclosed with either single or double quotation marks.
! Logical values are case-insensitive and can be either .true., true, or t for a TRUE value, and .false., false, or f for a FALSE value.
! All vectors and arrays in the input file begin with index 1. This is following the convention of 
! the majority of science-oriented programming languages: Fortran, Julia, Mathematica, MATLAB, and R.
