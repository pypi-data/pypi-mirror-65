# Import the WebSocket object from pybit.
from pybit import WebSocket

We can also import the HTTP object at the same time using.

from pybit import HTTP, WebSocket

Additionally, we can simply import all of pybit and use each
object selectively.

import pybit
client = pybit.HTTP(...)
ws = pybit.WebSocket(...)
