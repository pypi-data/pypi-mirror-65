        Fruit

        The readme is under development...
        
        Roadmap
        -------
        
        
        * yaml syntax checking for step types
        * step type: ``fruit`` to ripen a fruit inside a ripening
        * finish implementing step type: job
        * better documentation
        * implement unit tests
        
        The fruits
        ----------
        
        The fruits (\ ``fruit.yaml``\ ) are the pipeline configuration files. They contain all the
        necessary information to execute commands, use global variables and list expansions.
        
        Name
        ~~~~
        
        Each fruit needs a name, which will identify the project the fruit belongs to.
        To set the project name, use the following syntax:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
           name: My Project Name
        
        Description
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The description field shall contain a longer description of the project, its goal
        and the jobs defined in the fruit file. To set the description, use the following sytnax:
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
           desc: Create automated builds, package documentation, etc...
        
        Global variables
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        It is possible to define global variables in the fruit file, which will be substituted during the yaml loading.
        
        To create a global variable, add a new key-value pair to the list ``glob``.
        
        .. code-block:: yaml
        
           glob:
             libpath: /usr/lib/
             binpath: $(libpath)bin
        
        After the global variable is created it can be referenced with the sytax ``$(<name>)``.
        
        It's important to note, that global variables are propagated only downwards. As a consequence of this they affect:
        
        
        * global variables define below,
        * lists,
        * step commands,
        * step arguments.
