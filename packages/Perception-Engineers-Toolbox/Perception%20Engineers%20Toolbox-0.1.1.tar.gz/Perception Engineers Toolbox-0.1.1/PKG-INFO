Description: # Perception Engineer's Toolbox
        
        A toolbox of easily programmable and adjustable functions for eye-tracking data processing and analysis.
        
        The program is separated into a very minimalistic main program with the responsibility to load and call plugins as well
        as to manage their interconnections.
        The plugins perform all heavy lifting, such as importing and processing data. Some plugins might require others to be
        run before their functionality is accessible (such as calculating metrics on fixations and detecting fixations). They
        also assert these assumptions.
        
        ## Installation
        1. Install dependencies\
            `pip install cython wheel numpy tabel yapsy pyyaml pillow`\
            `pip install scipy sklearn pomegranate matplotlib pandas h5py`
        
            You can get rid of the second set of dependencies if you deactivate certain plugins that require those. The core library does not make direct use of them. For a list of plugin dependencies see `toolbox.py`
        
        2. Running the examples\
            `python toolbox.py -C test/commandlist.yaml`\
            `python toolbox.py -D test/scripttest.py`
        
        ## Interfacing with the toolbox
        You can run your own analysis either through a YAML command file (see `test/commandlist.yaml` for an example) or through a custom python script (see `test/scripttest.py` for an example).
