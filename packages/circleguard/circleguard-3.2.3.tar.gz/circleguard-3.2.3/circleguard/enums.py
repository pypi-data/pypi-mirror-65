    Notes
    -----
    The nightcore mod is never set by itself. When we see plays set with ``NC``,
    we are really seeing a ``DT + NC`` play. ``NC`` by itself is ``512``, but
    what we expect to see is ``576`` (``512 + 64``; ``DT`` is ``64``). As such
    ``Mod.NC`` is defined to be the more intuitive versionâ€”``DT + NC``. We
    provide the true, technical version of the ``NC`` mod (``512``) as
    ``Mod._NC``.

    This same treatment and reasoning applies to ``Mod.PF``, which we define
    as ``PF + SD``. The technical version of PF is available as ``Mod._PF``.

    Warnings
    --------
    The fact that this class subclasses ModCombination is slightly misleading.
    This is only done so that this class can be instantiated directly, backed
