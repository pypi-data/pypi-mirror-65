Description: GhostWriter lets you edit a website via lektor, a flexible and powerful static content management system for building complex and beautiful websites out of flat files - for people who do not want to make a  compromise between a CMS and a static blog engine. 
        
        If you want to edit a website with the ease of a CMS and share it as static pages GhostWriter starts a lektor server locally and include some git functionalities to transparently upload your changes or retrieve updates from an upstream repository. GhostWriter also allow you to share your work via .onion, by using OnionShare or a nginx webserver running on a Docker container. Everything is always hosted on your machine, and disappear when you shutdown GhostWriter. The .onion can be accessed via Tor Browser.
