Description: # WeasyPrint Daemon
        
        ## Protocol
        
        ### start header
        
        On startup, wpd sends a header to stdout, always on a single line:
        
        ```
        {"wpd": "<implementation name>", "version": "<version>", "protocol": "1"}\n
        ```
        
        ### job submission
        
        job submission, to stdin:
        
        ```
        {"id": "xxx", "css": "css content", "size": <html content size>}\n
        html content\n
        ```
        
        The json header must be on _one line_.
        
        ### cancel job
        
        ```
        {"id": "xxx", "action": "cancel"}\n
        ```
        
        The job may be canceled by the renderer, but may also be rendered and returned.
        
        
        ### get results
        
        result retrieval, from stdout:
        
        ```
        {"id": "xxx", "size": <file size>}\n
        PDF content\n
        ```
        
        The json header will always be on _one line_.
        
        Any error will be reported as following:
        ```
        {"id": "xxx", "error": ""}
        ```
        
        ### stopping
        
        To stop the daemon, just close stdin
