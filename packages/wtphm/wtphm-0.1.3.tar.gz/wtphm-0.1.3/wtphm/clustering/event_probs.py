"""This module is for working with events data from wind turbines.
It looks at all eventes generated and sees if there are some events which
trigger others. Event A triggers Event B if:
t_s_A <= t_s_B and t_e_A >= t_s_B

So we can find the probability that any given A event (known as a parent event)
has triggered any B events, and the probability that any given B event (known
as a child event) has been triggered by any A events.
