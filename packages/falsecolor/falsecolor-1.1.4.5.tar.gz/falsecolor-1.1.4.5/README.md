# FalseColor-Python

A rapid digital staining module designed for translating two-channel fluorescence images (i.e. a nuclear and cytoplasmic stain) to the traditional H&E histopathology color space. Virtual H&E coloring methods based on: [Giacomelli et al.](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159337)


## Installation

In order to use FalseColor Python's GPU acceleration install cudatoolkit using conda:
```bash
conda install cudatoolkit
```

FalseColor Python can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install falsecolor
```

Or by running setup.py install while in the working directory.

```bash
python setup.py install
```


## Usage
See Examples to get started.

Several methods within color.py are setup with GPU acceleration using numba.cuda.jit:
(See Example/GPU examples.ipynb)

#Set color levels for false coloring using background subtraction
```python
import FalseColor.coloring as fc
#Using Defaults:
settings_dict = fc.getDefaultRGBsettings()
nuclei_RGBsettings = settings_dict['nuclei']
cyto_RGBsettings = settings_dict['cyto']
```

```python
#Or Levels can be set manually, provided they are in the following order
nuclei_RGBsettings = [R,G,B] # list of floats (0.0:1.0) for color levels in nuclear channel
cyto_RGBsettings = [R,G,B] # list of floats (0.0:1.0) for color levels in cyto channel

#nuclei,cyto are 2D numpy arrays for false coloring see GPU example.ipynb for more details
pseudo_colored_data = fc.rapidFalseColor(nuclei,cyto,
                                         nuclei_RGBsettings,cyto_RGBsettings)
```
