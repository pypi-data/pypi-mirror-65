Description: # A tiny utility to quickly clone github repos
        
        ## Usage
        Set your local repo directory via the CLONER_PATH environment variable
        ``` bash
        echo "export CLONER_PATH=\"~/repos\"" >> ~/.bash_profile
        ```
        
        Then you can clone any github repo into that directory with the username and repo name, like this:
        ``` bash
        cloner kardasis cloner
        ```
        will clone this repo into `~/repos/kardasis/cloner`
        
        
        You can also use the web URL from the repo
        ``` bash
        cloner https://github.com/kardasis/cloner
        ```
        or any URL from within the repo
        ``` bash
        cloner https://github.com/kardasis/cloner/blob/master/cloner/cli.py
        ```
