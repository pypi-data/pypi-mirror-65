## Microsoft Azure SDK for Python

This is the Microsoft Azure Cost Management Client Library.

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the next generation of management APIs
that replace the old Azure Service Management (ASM).

This package has been tested with Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

For the older Azure Service Management (ASM) libraries, see
[azure-servicemanagement-legacy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure-servicemanagement-legacy)
library.

For a more complete set of Azure libraries, see the
[azure](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/azure) bundle package.

## Usage

For code examples, see [Cost
Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/) on
docs.microsoft.com.

# Release History

## 0.2.0 (2020-04-08)

**Features**

  - Added operation DimensionsOperations.list
  - Added operation QueryOperations.usage

**Breaking changes**

  - Model QueryDataset no longer has parameter sorting
  - Removed operation DimensionsOperations.list_by_subscription
  - Removed operation QueryOperations.usage_by_scope

**General Breaking Changes**

This version uses a next-generation code generator that *might*
introduce breaking changes. In summary, some modules were incorrectly
visible/importable and have been renamed. This fixed several issues
caused by usage of classes that were not supposed to be used in the
first place.

  - CostManagementClient cannot be imported from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` anymore (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement` works like before)
  - CostManagementClientConfiguration import has been moved from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.cost_management_client` to `azure.mgmt.costmanagement`
  - A model `MyClass` from a "models" sub-module cannot be imported
    anymore using `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models.my_class` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.models` works like before)
  - An operation class `MyClassOperations` from an `operations`
    sub-module cannot be imported anymore using
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations.my_class_operations` (import from
    `azure.mgmt.costmanagement.operations` works like before)

Last but not least, HTTP connection pooling is now enabled by default.
You should always use a client as a context manager, or call close(), or
use no more than one client per process.
