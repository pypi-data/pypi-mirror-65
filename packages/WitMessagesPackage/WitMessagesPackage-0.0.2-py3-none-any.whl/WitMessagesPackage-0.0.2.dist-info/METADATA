### Generating distribution archives [PIP-PACKAGE]
> Make sure you have the latest versions of setuptools and wheel installed:
```sh
$ cpython3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
```
> Now run this command from the same directory where setup.py is located:
```sh
$ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```
> This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the dist directory.

### Uploading the distribution archives
```sh
$ python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
$ python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
```
> You will be prompted for a username and password. For the username, use __token__. For the password, use the token value, including the pypi- prefix (nano ./pypirc).

### Installing your newly uploaded package
```sh
$ pip install WitMessagesPackage
```
