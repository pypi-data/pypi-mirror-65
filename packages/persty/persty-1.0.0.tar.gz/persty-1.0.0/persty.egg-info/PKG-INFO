Description: # `persty` - Minibox and Delaunay Edges Algorithms
        
        This package provides an implementation of algorithms for finding the
        *Minibox* and *Delaunay* edges on a finite set of points in d-dimensional
        space with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_distance">Chebyshev distance</a>.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install it with
        
        ```
        >>> pip install persty
        ```
        
        For the installation to complete succesfully you need
        
        - `setuptools` and `numpy` installed in the current Python environment;
        - a `C` compiler for the module to be built. On Windows download and install
          <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/">Visual Studio community</a>.
        
        To use the functionality of the `persty.util` submodule it is also necessary to
        install the <a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/gudhi">`gudhi`</a> Python package.
        If you installed <a href="https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/">`conda`</a> this can be obtained by running the following command in a terminal window.
        
        ```
        >>> conda install -c conda-forge gudhi
        ```
        
        ## Basic usage
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import persty.minibox
        import persty.delaunay
        
        np.random.seed(0)
        points = np.random.rand(20, 2).tolist()
        
        minibox_edges = persty.minibox.edges(points)
        delaunay_edges = persty.delaunay.edges(points)
        ```
        
        ## Computing Persistent Homology
        
        Minibox and Delaunay edges can be used to compute
        persistent homology in homological dimensions zero and one.
        
        The `pesty` package provides a wrapper function to generate a `gudhi.SimplexTree()`
        object that can be used to compute persistence diagrams of Minibox and Alpha Clique
        filtrations.
        
        The following code computes the zero and one dimensional persistence diagrams
        of 100 three-dimensional randomly sampled points in the unit cube.
        
        ```python
        import numpy as np
        import persty.minibox
        import persty.util
        from scipy.spatial.distance import chebyshev
        
        np.random.seed(0)
        points = np.random.rand(100, 3).tolist()
        minibox_edges = persty.minibox.edges(points)
        simplex_tree = persty.util.make_gudhi_simplex_tree(points,
                                                           minibox_edges,
                                                           max_simplex_dim=2,
                                                           metric=chebyshev)
        persistence_diagrams = simplex_tree.persistence(homology_coeff_field=2,
                                                        persistence_dim_max=False)
        ```
        
        ## Tests
        
        To check that this package was installed correctly you can run the tests in
        the `test/` directory of this repository.
        
        - Download this repository on you computer by running the following command in
        a terminal window.
        
        ```
        >>> git clone https://github.com/gbeltramo/persty.git
        ```
        
        *Note*
        
        On Windows you can obtain `git` by installing the <a href="https://chocolatey.org/">
        `chocolatey`</a> package manager, and running
        
        ```
        >>> choco install git
        ```
        
        - In a terminal window move to the `persty` directory you just downloaded.
        
        - If you do not have the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest/">`pytest`</a>
        package installed run
        
        ```
        >>> pip install pytest
        ```
        
        - Finally run
        
        ```
        >>> pytest
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```
        >>> pytest -q
        ```
        
        The second option decreases the verbosity of the output of this command.
