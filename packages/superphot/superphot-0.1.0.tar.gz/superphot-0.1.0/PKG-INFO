Description: # Superphot
        Superphot is an open-source Python package for photometric classification of supernovae, based on the method of Villar et al. ([2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...884...83V/abstract)). To apply this method, you must have the full _griz_ light curve and redshift (e.g., from the host galaxy) for each transient. As such, Superphot is designed for use by time-domain surveys to retrospectively classify transients that were not observed spectroscopically, not for real-time classification.
        
        In Villar et al. ([2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...884...83V/abstract)) and Dauphin et al. ([2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AAS...23527618D/abstract)), we trained the classifier on a sample of ~500 spectroscopically classified supernovae from the [Pan-STARRS1](https://panstarrs.stsci.edu) Medium Deep Survey, and then applied it to an additional ~3000 transients with host galaxy redshifts. This trained classifier is included in the package, but users will most likely want to train on their own survey data for better performance.
