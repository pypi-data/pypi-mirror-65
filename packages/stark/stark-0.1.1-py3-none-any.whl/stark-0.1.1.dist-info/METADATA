Stark is a python tool that generates random and strong passwords.

The password can include the following characters

```
lowercase       abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
uppercase       ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
digits          0123456789
letters         abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
alphanumeric    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
hexdigits       0123456789abcdefABCDEF
symbols         !"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~
```

## Installation

```
pip install stark
```

## Usage

### From python

```python
from stark import generate

length = 30
types = {'lowercase':15,'digits':10,'symbols':True}
password = generate(length=length,types=types)
# The remaining number of characters is 30 - 15 - 10 = 5
# Thus, the number of symbols in the password will be remainder = 5

length = 30
types = {'lowercase':15,'digits':True,'symbols':True}
password = generate(length=length,types=types)
# The remaining number of characters is 30 - 15 = 15
# Thus, the number of digits and symbols in the password will be a random partition of remainder = 15
# e.g (7,8) or (10,5) or (9,6) etc ...
# the partition will not contain a value of 0
# i.e the occurance of each type in the password will be greater than or equal 1

length = None
types = {'lowercase':15,'uppercase':5,'digits':7}
password = generate(length=length,types=types)
# If length is None, the password length will be the sum of the values of types.
# Thus, it's not allowed to have one value equals True while password length is None.
```
