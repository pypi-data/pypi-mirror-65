        =========
        
        *A Command Line Interface for Jira*
        
        Install
        -------
        
        pip install jira-simple-cli 
        
        Usage
        ------
        
        jira --help
        
        Purpose
        -------
        
        Avoid using a browser to intereact with Jira.
        This project helps create tickets quickly.
        
        The idea is to expand this project to be able to manage your workload with it:
        - Query tickets
        - Assign tickets
        - Change Status
        - Comment a ticket
        - ...
        - Profit
        
        Develop
        -------
        
        Install Requirements
        
            $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        
        If you'd like to run all tests for this project (*assuming you've written
        some*), you would run the following command::
        
            $ pytest tests
        
        Lastly, if you'd like to cut a new release of this CLI tool, and publish it to
        the Python Package Index (`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_), you can do so
        by running::
        
            $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
            $ twine upload dist/*
        
        This will build both a source tarball of your CLI tool, as well as a newer wheel
        build (*and this will, by default, run on all platforms*).
        
        The ``twine upload`` command (which requires you to install the `twine
        <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine>`_ tool) will then securely upload your
        new package to PyPI so everyone in the world can use it!
