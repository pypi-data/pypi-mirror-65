Low priority:
* rehaul background bounds
* fine tune bus priority and event checking
* make detailed signals instead of putting everything in event properties

Unclear if doable:
* make emitting signals a decorator
* make bus firing a decorator

Unclear if it provides an advantage
* abolish the CONFIG, COLORS and dunder singletons
