        # Instagram Account Details Extraction
        I have used a python code to extract the details of a given username, the searchDisplay() searches for the given username and prints the extracted data and the getDetails() searches for the given username and returns the extracted data in form of a dictionary.
        ## How to Use
        Clone the repository and run the main.py file and enter a valid username as input.
        ## Requirements
        For running this you need to have Python3 installed.
        
        Then, run the command 
        
        >***pip install -r requirements.txt***
        
        
        This will instantly install all the libraies needed.
