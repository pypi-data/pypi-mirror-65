# Instagram Account Details Extraction
I have used a python code to extract the details of a given username, the searchDisplay() searches for the given username and prints the extracted data and the getDetails() searches for the given username and returns the extracted data in form of a dictionary.
## How to Use
Clone the repository and run the main.py file and enter a valid username as input.
## Requirements
For running this you need to have Python3 installed.

Then, run the command 

>***pip install -r requirements.txt***


This will instantly install all the libraies needed.
