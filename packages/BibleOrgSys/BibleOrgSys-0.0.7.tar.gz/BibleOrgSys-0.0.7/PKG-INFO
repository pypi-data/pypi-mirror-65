Description: 
        Bible Organisational System / BibleOrgSys / BOS
        
        A system for importing and extracting various book/chapter/verse (BCV) texts,
        including Bibles of course, but also other related BCV materials like Bible commentaries.
        
        NOTE: This packaging is still being tested following massive restructuring,
        and is not necessarily fully functional until it is marked as v0.1.0 or higher.
        We also have hopes to improve documentation before v0.2.0.
        
        A future package of apps that use the BOS is also planned for release.
        After that point, we also hope to release a Snap version.
        
        This software has been developed in small chunks of spare time since 2010
        (so it's not necessarily well-thought out, and definitely not polished).
        However, it has been tested on hundreds of Bible filesets,
        including USFM, OSIS, USX, USFX, and other import formats.
        
        No attempt at all has been made at memory or speed optimisations
        and this is not planned until after the release of v1.0.0.
        
        This software forms the basis of the online Bible Drop Box service
        hosted at http://Freely-Given.org/Software/BibleDropBox/.
        
        This package will not reach v1.0.0 until versification mapping is added.
        
        The API will not become fixed/stable until the v1.0.0 release.
