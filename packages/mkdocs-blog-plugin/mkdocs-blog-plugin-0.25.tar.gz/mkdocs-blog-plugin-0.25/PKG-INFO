Description: « Blogs for MkDocs » (MkDocs-Blog-Plugin)
        =========================================
        
        | This plugin allows you to host a tiny blog
          section in your MkDocs site.
        | Move away, WordPress... well, not really.

        How does it work ?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        | It's quite simple. 90% of the work is already done by
          MkDocs itself.
        | Each time you will build your MkDocs site or serve it,
          this plugin will try to find a specific directory
          in your documentation folder.
          If it finds it, every document and every subdirectory
          nested in it will be listed in reverse on the navbar.
          Plus, if you will have too many documents to be listed
          at once, the plugin will try to organize your remaining
          documents in subfolders.
        
        How can I install it ?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        | You can install it through pip with this
          command:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            pip install mkdocs-blog-plugin
        
        | Then, open your ``mkdocs.yml`` configuration
          file and add these lines:
        
        .. code:: yaml
        
            plugins:
                - blog
        
        | Last but not least, enter you ``docs`` folder
          and create a new subfolder and name it ``blog``.
          This plugin will try to find blog articles
          inside this directory.
        
        Then you are ready to begin.
        
        How can I add new articles to my blog section ?
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        | Inside ``docs/blog`` create a folder for each
          year you are planning to add new articles.
          Then, inside each year folder create twelve
          folders, numbered from ``01`` to ``12`` for each
          month. Finally, in each month folder for each day
          create a corresponding folder but remember to add
          a leading zero (for example: ``08``, ``09``, ``10``, ...)
          Now, for every article you will go inside
          the corresponding \`year/month/day folder and you
          will create a new file there.
          While it is not necessary that you keep this
          strict naming convention, this will help the plugin
          to understand when your article was made.
        
        | For example, this is how I manage my blog folder:
        
        .. code:: sh
        
            docs
            ├── blog
            │   ├── 2019
            │   └── 2020
            │       ├── 01
            │       │   ├── 20
            │       │   │   └── first-article.md
            │       │   └── 26
            │       │       └── second-article.md
            │       ├── 02
            │       │   ├── 01
            │       │   │   └── third_article.md
            │       │   └── 09
            │       │       └── fourth-article.md
            │       └── 03
            │           └── 16
            │               └── fifth-article.md
            └── index.md
        
        Customizing the plugins
