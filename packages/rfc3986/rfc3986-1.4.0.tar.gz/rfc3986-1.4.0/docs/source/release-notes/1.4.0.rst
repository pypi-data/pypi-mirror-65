1.3.0 -- 2020-04-07
-------------------

Security
~~~~~~~~

- Prevent users from receiving an invalid authority parsed from a malicious
  URL. Previously we did not stop parsing the authority section at the first
  backslash (``\\``) character. As a result, it was possible to trick our
  parser into parsing up to the first forward-slash (``/``) and thus 
  generating an invalid authority.
