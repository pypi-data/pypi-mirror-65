# (lb): Retrieve pointer to module object instance, so functions can set.
# - If we did not do this, function scoping would create local variables.
# - I'll admit this feels a little weird, but we need to gait access to the
#   ansi_escape_room package. Using a fake "this", like we do here, is one
#   way to gait access. Another would be to use a module-level dictionary
#   variable that module functions could set. Or we could make a Singleton
#   class. A fourth option would be to move features in this wrapper inside
#   the ansi-escape-room package. (I created this file before creating
#   ansi-escape-room (a fork of another user's package, named "colored"),
#   and it works fine, and it's pretty simple, so keeping it... for now.)
# MAYBE/2020-02-01: What about using nark's new singleton class instead?

# (lb): We had been enabling colors until disabled, but it seems more
# normal to assume no colors until at least the user's config is read
# and the command line arguments are parsed! The one drawback is that
# now some module- and class-scope strings can no longer be formatted
# when sourced, but must be generated at runtime, after the config is
# loaded.
