Description: Auto DCF
        ========

        The autodcf package aims to make it extremely simple to create DCF models, simple and complex alike.
        If you are tired of running sensitivity tests to see how your model will behave with different sales growth patterns, this package is for you.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        You can clone the repo from GitHub using
        
        .. code::
        
           git clone https://github.com/jackmoody11/autodcf
        
        Setup the project by navigating to the project root directory and running
        
        .. code::
        
           python setup.py
        
        Basic Usage
        -----------
        There are a few important classes which will help you build your DCF.
        The ``Company`` class encapsulates three classes: ``BalanceSheet``, ``CashFlows``,
        and ``IncomeStatement``. Once a ``Company`` object is created using the 3
        financial statements, this can be passed to one of the DCF models (currently either ``SimpleDCF``
        or ``DCF``).
        
        .. code:: python
        
           from autodcf.company import BalanceSheet, CashFlows, Company, IncomeStatement
           from autodcf.models import SimpleDCF
        
           balance_sheet = BalanceSheet(assets=100, liabilities=50)
           cash_flows = CashFlows(capex=3)
           income_statement = IncomeStatement(sales=100,
                                              cogs=50,
                                              sga=25,
                                              rd=0,
                                              depreciation=4,
                                              amortization=2,
                                              interest=0,
                                              nonrecurring_cost=3,
                                              tax=4)
           company = Company(balance_sheet=balance_sheet,
                             cash_flows=cash_flows,
                             income_statement=income_statement,
                             price_per_share=2.00,
                             fully_diluted_shares=100)
           simple_dcf = SimpleDCF(change_in_nwc_to_change_in_sales=0.1,
                                  company=company,
                                  discount_rate=0.14,
                                  sales_growth=0.03,
                                  tax_rate=0.21,
                                  terminal_growth_rate=0.03,
                                  window=5)
           forecast = simple_dcf.forecast()
        
        The code above will provide a filled out pandas DataFrame with estimated growth of different
        line items from the income statement.
        
        TODO
        ----
        - Add docs and deploy using doctr to GitHub Pages site (automate deployment with Travis CI)
        - Publish package to PyPi
        
        
        Future Enhancements
        -------------------
        - ``io``: Allow for DCF model to be exported to Excel
        - ``data``: Allow users to specify what company and data source
          to use and fetch necessary data for B/S, CF, and I/S behind the scenes
        - ``company``: Allow for integration with financial data APIs
        - ``models``: Add different types of models (with/without synergies)
