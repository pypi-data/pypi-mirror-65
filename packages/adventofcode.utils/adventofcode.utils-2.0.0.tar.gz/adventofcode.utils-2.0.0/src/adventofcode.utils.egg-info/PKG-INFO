Description: # Advent of Code Utility Classes
        
        A bunch of utility classes for Advent of Code problems. As I have worked on Advent of Code problems a number of utility classes have been created that help solve problems.
        
        - Point2D - 2D point
        - Point3D - 3D point
        - Stack - Simple implementation of a Stack (LIFO)
