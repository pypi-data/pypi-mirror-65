        ## DISCLAIMER
        
        We are not economists. We are not epidemiologists. All core assumptions that
        are related to each of these fields are taken from experts. This is not an
        academic paper and has not gone through a peer review process. As a pandemic
        in modern times is a unique event, it is not possible to model resulting
        economics events with any degree of certainty. The best we can likely hope
        for is to maintain multiple plausible scenarios that can be used to inform high
        level strategic planning.
        
        Any examples provided in this paper or documentation are NOT to be taken as
        ready for use in any particular use case.
        
        ## Step 1: Read the paper
        
        It's [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cD82e4LuWe0lUrHlFCy9GBYMcJesbVRGy9zBlU9r0wM/)
        
        Read it and understand it. It does not make sense to use this without
        understanding the assumptions and structure.
        
        ## Step 2: See the API usage
        
        Say that you have a 10 week sales forecast in which you will sell
        100 euros each week. You would express this forecast using a simple
        python list:
        
        ```py
        forecast = [100] * 10
        ```
        
        Assuming a single 3-week lockdown starting on the second week:
        
        ```py
        lockdowns = [
            {
                'start': 1,
                'length': 3,
                'immediate_loss': 0.9,
                'client_deaths': generic_linear_func(
                    x_intercept=0.05, slope=0.05),
                'lockdown_growth': generic_linear_func(
                    x_intercept=0.0, slope=0.01)
            }
        ]
        ```
        
        And the corresponding recovery:
        
        ```py
        recoveries = [
            {
                'client_recovery': generic_linear_func(
                    x_intercept=0.1, slope=0.01),
                'market_appetite': generic_linear_func(0.2, 0.02)
            }
        ]
        ```
        
        You would model your forecast like so:
        
        ```py
        rm = RecoveryModel(
            normal_forecast=forecast,
            lockdowns=lockdowns,
            recoveries=recoveries
        )
        
        adjusted_forecasts = rm.model_recovery()
        ```
        
        And your adjusted forecasts should look like so:
        
        ```py
        [
            # start business as usual
            100.0,
            # start lockdown
            10.0,
            11.0,
            12.0,
            # start recovery
            30.0,   # .12 + ( (.85 + .10) * .20 )
            32.0,   # .12 + ( (.85 + .11) * .22 )
            34.0,   # .12 + ( (.85 + .12) * .24 )
            36.0,   # .12 + ( (.85 + .13) * .26 )
            38.0,   # .12 + ( (.85 + .14) * .28 )
            41.0,   # forecast end
        ]
        ```
        
        ## Step 3: Make your own forecast
        
        This part will be hard. Selecting the parameters for the model is insanely
        difficult and requires a TON of industry knowledge. You should probably
        maintain several different scenarios and update them as more data, policy,
        and other information becomes available.
