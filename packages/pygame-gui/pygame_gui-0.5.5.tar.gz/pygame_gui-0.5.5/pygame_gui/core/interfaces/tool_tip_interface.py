       A meta class that defines the interface that a UI Tool tip uses.

        The algorithm starts from the position of the target we are providing a tool tip for then it
        tries to fit the rectangle for the tool tip onto the screen by moving it above, below, to
        the left and to the right, until we find a position that fits the whole tooltip rectangle
        on the screen at once.
