# Money On Chain

Money On Chain is a suite of smart contracts dedicated to providing a bitcoin-collateralized
stable-coin, Dollar On Chain, (DoC); a passive income holder-targeted token, BitPro (BPRO),
and a leveraged Bitcoin investment instrument (BTCX series). The rationale behind this is that
deposits of Rootstock-BTC (RBTC) help collateralize the DoCs, BitPro absorbs the USD-BTC rate fluctuations,
and BTC2X is leveraged borrowing value from BitPro and DoC holders, with a
daily interest rate being paid to the former.
