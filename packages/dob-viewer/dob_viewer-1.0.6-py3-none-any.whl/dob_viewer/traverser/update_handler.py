    # FIXME: (lb): These time +/- bindings are pretty cool,
    #        but they should and/or create conflicts,
    #        or affect the time of adjacent facts...
    #        so you may need to show times of adjacent facts,
    #        and/or you could auto-adjust adjacent facts' times,
    #        perhaps not letting user decrement below time of fact
    #        before it, or increment above time of fact after it.
    #        (at least need to preload the before and after facts for
    #        the current fact).
    #        for now, you can raw-edit factoid to change type
    #        and resolve conflicts. or you could edit facts in
    #        carousel and resolve conflicts yourself, before saving.
    #
    #        maybe if you begin to edit time, then you show
    #        adjacent fact's (or facts') time(s).
    #
    #        I think easiest option is to just adjust adjacent
    #        facts' times -- without showing them -- and to
    #        stop at boundary, i.e., when adjacent fact would
    #        be at 0 time (albeit, when if seconds don't match?
    #        you should normalize and remove seconds when you
    #        you adjust time!)
    #    1.  - normalize to 0 seconds on adjust
    #    2.  - change adjacent facts' time(s), too
    #    3.  - stop at adjacent fact boundary
    #    4.  - option to delete fact -- so user could either change to
    #          adjacent fact and edit its time to make more room for
    #          fact being re-timed; or user could switch to adjacent
    #          fact and delete it, poof!
    #    5.  - undo/redo stack of edit_facts
    #          e.g., undo delete fact command, or undo any edit:
    #             act@cat, tags, description!
    #             keep a copy of undo fact in carousel
    #    6.  - insert new fact -- or split fact! split fact in twain...
    #          YES! you could even have a split fact command, and then
    #          a clear fact command ... (s)plit fact... (C)lear fact...
    #          or maybe (S) and (C) ... this makes the redo/undo trickier...
    #          perhaps each redo/undo state is a copy of edit_facts?
    #          i think the trickier part is coordinating new_facts
    #          and edit_facts -- the lookup can return multiple facts,
    #          i'm guessing... and then the new split facts will just
    #          show the diff each against the same base fact... and on
    #          save... what? they all have the same split_from, I guess...
    #          because we don't really use split_from yet... OK, this is
    #          doable, super doable... and it could make my fact entering
    #          at end of day easier? or fact cleanup, i should mean, e.g.,
    #          if I had a fact that was 6 hours long, I could split it
    #          in two, and then adjust the time quickly with arrow keys!
    #    7.  - (h)elp option? TOGGLE HELP IN DESCRIPTION BOX!! You could
    #          probably easily redraw the header, too, to not show a fact...
    #          maybe use Header and Description area -- can I use a new
    #          Layout item or whatever from PPT and swap out current
    #          display? OR, leave the Fact header, because user might
    #          want to use one of the HELP KEYS while VIEWING THE HELP.
    #          So show help, and on any command, clear the help!
    #          And does this mean I should add more meta to the key bindings
    #          and build the help automatically? Or should I, say, just
    #          make a custom string and maintain the help separately?
    #          the latter is probably easiest...
    #          - Use different background color when displaying the help!
    #
    #        - user can use left/right to see adjacent facts, like normal
    #          (i.e., do not add more widgets/info to carousel!)
    #        - user can adjust adjacent facts' times as well, to
    #          keep pushing facts' times around
    #
    #    X.  - swap 2 adjacent Facts? seems like it makes sense,
    #          but also seems useless, as in, what use case would
    #          have user wanting to swap 2 facts?? i've never wanted
    #          to do that.
