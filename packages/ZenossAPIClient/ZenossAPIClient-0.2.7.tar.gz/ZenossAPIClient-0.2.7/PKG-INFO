Description: 
        Python module for interacting with the Zenoss API an an object-oriented way.
        The philosophy here is to use objects to work with everything in the Zenoss 
        API, and to try to normalize the various calls to the different routers.
        Thus `get` methods will always return an object, `list` methods will return 
        data. All methods to add or create start with `add`, all remove or delete 
        start with `delete`. As much as possible the methods try to hide the 
        idiosyncrasies of the JSON API, and to do the work for you, for example 
        by letting you use a device name instead of having to provide the full 
        device UID for every call.
