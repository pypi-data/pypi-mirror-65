        This is the way it works
        
        When you enter the start balance it puts a record in the table balances with a seq of 1 and a balance of whatever you set
        
        When you enter the first account line with seq =2 it reads the record from balances and adds or deletes debit and credit. It the adds another record in balances with seq = 2
        
        When you add the next account line with seq = 3 it again reads the record (seq=2) from balances, adds or subtracts debit and credit and writes record with seq= 3 into balances
        
        Each subsequent account line does the same thing so that the table balances keeps up to date.
