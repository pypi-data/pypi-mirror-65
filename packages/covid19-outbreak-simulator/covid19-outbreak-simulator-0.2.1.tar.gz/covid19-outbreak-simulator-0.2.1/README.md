# COVID-19 Outbreak Simulator

The COVID-19 outbreak simulator simulates the outbreak of COVID-19 in a population. It was first designed to simulate
the outbreak of COVID-19 in small populations in enclosed environments, such as a FPSO (floating production storage and
offloading vessel) but has since been expanded to simulate much larger populations with dynamic parameters.

This README file contains all essential information but you can also visit our [documentation](https://covid19-outbreak-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for more details.

## Background

This simulator simulates the scenario in which

-   A group of individuals in a population in which everyone is susceptible.
-   The population can be divided into multiple subgroups with different parameters.
-   One or more virus carriers are introduced to the population, potentially after a fixed
    days of self-quarantine.
-   Infectees are by default removed from from the population (or separated, or
    quarantined, as long as he or she can no longer infect others) after they
    displayed symptoms, but options are provided to act otherwise.

The simulator simulates the epidemic of the population with the introduction of
infectors. Detailed statistics are captured from the simulations to answer questions
such as:

1. What is the expected day and distribution for the first person to show
   symptoms?
2. How many people are expected to be removed once an outbreak starts?
3. How effective will self-quarantine before dispatch personnels to an
   enclosed environment?

The simulator uses the latest knowledge about the spread of COVID-19 and is
validated against public data. This project will be contantly updated with our
deepening knowledge on this virus.

## Modeling the outbreak of COVID-19

We developed multiple statistical models to model the incubation time, serial interval,
generation time, proportion of asymptomatic transmissions, using results from
multiple publications. We validated the models with empirical data to ensure they
generate, for example, correct distributions of serial intervals and proporitons
of asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic cases.

The statistical models and related references are available at

-   [Statistical models of COVID-19 outbreaks (Version 1)](https://bioworkflows.com/ictr/COVID19-outbreak-simulator-model/1)
-   [Statistical models of COVID-19 outbreaks (Version 2)](https://bioworkflows.com/ictr/COVID19-outbreak-simulator-model/2)

The models will continuously be updated as we learn more about the virus.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --popsize POPSIZE [POPSIZE ...]
                        Size of the population, including the infector that
                        will be introduced at the beginning of the simulation.
                        It should be specified as a single number, or a serial
                        of name=size values for different groups. For example
                        "--popsize nurse=10 patient=100". The names will be
                        used for setting group specific parameters. The IDs of
                        these individuals will be nurse0, nurse1 etc.
  --susceptibility SUSCEPTIBILITY [SUSCEPTIBILITY ...]
                        Weight of susceptibility. The default value is 1,
                        meaning everyone is equally susceptible. With options
                        such as "--susceptibility nurse=1.2 patients=0.8" you
                        can give weights to different groups of people so that
                        they have higher or lower probabilities to be
                        infected.
  --symptomatic-r0 SYMPTOMATIC_R0 [SYMPTOMATIC_R0 ...]
                        Production number of symptomatic infectors, should be
                        specified as a single fixed number, or a range, and/or
                        multipliers for different groups such as A=1.2. For
                        example "--symptomatic-r0 1.4 2.8 nurse=1.2" means a
                        general R0 ranging from 1.4 to 2.8, while nursed has a
                        range from 1.4*1.2 and 2.8*1.2.
  --asymptomatic-r0 ASYMPTOMATIC_R0 [ASYMPTOMATIC_R0 ...]
                        Production number of asymptomatic infectors, should be
                        specified as a single fixed number, or a range and/or
                        multipliers for different groups
  --incubation-period INCUBATION_PERIOD [INCUBATION_PERIOD ...]
                        Incubation period period, should be specified as
                        "lognormal" followed by two numbers as mean and sigma,
                        or "normal" followed by mean and sd, and/or
                        multipliers for different groups. Default to
                        "lognormal 1.621 0.418"
  --repeats REPEATS     Number of replicates to simulate. An ID starting from
                        1 will be assinged to each replicate and as the first
                        columns in the log file.
  --keep-symptomatic    Keep affected individuals in the population
  --pre-quarantine [PRE_QUARANTINE [PRE_QUARANTINE ...]]
                        Days of self-quarantine before introducing infector to
                        the group. The simulation will be aborted if the
                        infector shows symptom before introduction. If you
                        quarantine multiple people or specified named groups,
                        you will need to append the IDs to the parameter (e.g.
                        --pre-quarantine day nurse1 nurse2
  --infectors [INFECTORS [INFECTORS ...]]
                        Infectees to introduce to the population, default to
                        '0'. If you would like to introduce multiple infectees
                        to the population, or if you have named groups, you
                        will have to specify the IDs of carrier such as
                        --infectors nurse1 nurse2
  --interval INTERVAL   Interval of simulation, default to 1/24, by hour
  --logfile LOGFILE     logfile
  --prop-asym-carriers [PROP_ASYM_CARRIERS [PROP_ASYM_CARRIERS ...]]
                        Proportion of asymptomatic cases. You can specify a
                        fix number, or two numbers as the lower and higher CI
                        (95%) of the proportion. Default to 0.10 to 0.40.
  --allow-lead-time     The seed carrier will be asumptomatic but always be at
                        the beginning of incurbation time. If allow lead time
                        is set to True, the carrier will be anywhere in his or
                        her incubation period.
  --analyze-existing-logfile
                        Analyze an existing logfile, useful for updating the
                        summarization procedure or uncaptured output.
  -j JOBS, --jobs JOBS  Number of process to use for simulation. Default to
                        number of CPU cores.

```

### Homogeneous and heterogeneous populations

```
outbreak_simulator
```

simulates the outbreak of COVID-19 in a population with 64 individuals, with one
introduced infector.

```
outbreak_simulator --popsize nurse=10 patient=100 --infector patient0
```

simulates a population with `10` nurses and `100` patients when the first patient
carries the virus.

### Change number of infectors

```
outbreak_simulator --infector 0 1 --pre-quarantine 7 0 1
```

simulates the introduction of two infectors, both after 7 days of quarantine. Here
`0` and `1` are IDs of individuals

### Changing model parameters

```
outbreak_simulator --prop-asym-carriers 0.10
```

runs the simulation with a fixed ratio of asymptomatic carriers.

```
outbreak_simulator --incubation-period normal 4 2
```

runs the simulation incubation period sampled from a normal distribution with
mean 4 and standard deviation of 2.

### Specigy group-specific parameters

Parameters `symptomatic-r0`, `asymptomatic-r0` and `incubation-period` can be
set to different values for each groups. These are achived by "multipliers",
which multiplies specified values to values drawn from the default distribution.

For example, if in a hospital environment nurses, once affected, tends to have
higher `R0` because he or she contact more patients, and on the other hand
patients are less mobile and should have lower `R0`. In some cases the nurses
are even less protected and are more susceptible. You can run a simulation
with two patients carrying the virus with the following options:

```
outbreak_simulator --popsize nurse=10 patient=100 \
    --symptomatic-r0 nurse=1.5 patient=0.8 \
    --asymptomatic-r0 nurse=1.5 patient=0.8 \
    --susceptibility nurse=1.2 patient=0.8 \
    --infector patient0 patient1
```

## Output from the simulator

The output file contains events that happens during the simulations.
For example, for command

```
outbreak_simulator --repeat 100 --popsize 64 --logfile result_remove_symptomatic.txt
```

You will get an output file `result_remove_symptomatic.txt` with the following columns:

| column   | content                                                                                                                |

The log file of a typical simulation would look like the following:

which I assume would be pretty self-explanatory. Note that **the simulation IDs
are not ordered because the they are run in parallel but you can expect all events
belong to the same simulation are recorded together.**.

## Summary report from multiple replicates

At the end of each command, a report will be given to summarize key statistics from
multiple replicated simulations. The output contains the following keys and their values

| name                                  | value                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Data analysis tools

Because all the events have been recorded in the log files, it should not be too difficult for
you to write your own script (e.g. in R) to analyze them and produce nice figures. We however
made a small number of tools available. Please feel free to submit or own script for inclusion in the `contrib`
library.

### `time_vs_size.R`

The [`contrib/time_vs_size.R`](https://github.com/ictr/covid19-outbreak-simulator/blob/master/contrib/time_vs_size.R) script provides an example on how to process the data and produce
a figure. It can be used as follows:

```
Rscript time_vs_size.R  simulation.log 'COVID19 Outbreak Simulation with Default Paramters' time_vs_size.png
```

and produces a figure

![time_vs_size.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ictr/covid19-outbreak-simulator/master/contrib/time_vs_size.png)

### `merge_summary.py`

[`contrib/merge_summary.py`](https://github.com/ictr/covid19-outbreak-simulator/blob/master/contrib/merge_summary.py) is a script to merge summary stats from multiple simulation runs.
