Description: 
        # shushi 🍤
        Minimalist secrets management in Python for Windows.
        
        Shushi was built to address the need for a one-stop storage location for sensitive data.  
        Instead of having your credentials scattered across your projects in multiple config files, Shushi offers an encrypted vault with access via a CLI application and an API.
        
        ## Requirements
        - Python 3.7.*
        
        ## Installation
        ```posh
        > pip install shushi
        ```
        
        ## CLI Usage
        Create a vault:
        ```posh
        > shushi -p [password] make
        ```
        
        Open a cli form to add an item to your vault:
        ```posh
        > shushi -p [password] add [name]
        ```
        
        Retrieve an item from your vault:
        ```posh
        > shushi -p [password] get [name]
        ```
        
        Remove an item from your vault:
        ```posh
        > shushi -p [password] remove [name]
        ```
        
        List all items in your vault:
        ```posh
        > shushi -p [password] list
        ```
