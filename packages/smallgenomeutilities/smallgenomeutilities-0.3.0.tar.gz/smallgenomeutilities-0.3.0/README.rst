The smallgenomeutilities are a collection of scripts that is useful for dealing and manipulating NGS data of small viral genomes. They are written in Python 3 with a small number of dependencies.


************

The recommended way to install the smallgenomeutilities is using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install smallgenomeutilities


************************
Description of utilities
************************

compute_mds
-----------
Compute multidimensional scaling for visualizing distances among reconstructed haplotypes.

convert_qr
----------
Convert QuasiRecomb output of a transmitter and recipient set of haplotypes to a combined set of haplotypes, where gaps have been filtered. Optionally translate to peptide sequence.

convert_reference
-----------------
Perform a genomic liftover. Transform an alignment in SAM or BAM format from one reference sequence to another. Can replace `M` states by `=`/`X`.

coverage
--------
Calculate average coverage for a target region on a different contig.

coverage_stats
--------------
Calculate average coverage for a target region of an alignment.

extract_consensus
-----------------
Build consensus sequences including either the majority base or the ambiguous bases from an alignment (BAM) file.

extract_coverage_intervals
--------------------------
Extract regions with sufficient coverage for running ShoRAH. Half-open intervals are returned, [start:end), and 0-based indexing is used.

extract_sam
-----------
Extract subsequences of an alignment, with the option of converting it to peptide sequences. Can filter on the basis of subsequence frequency or gap frequencies in subsequences.

extract_seq
-----------
Extract sequences of alignments into a FASTA file where the sequence id matches a given string.

mapper
------
Determine the genomic offsets on a target contig, given an initial contig and offsets. Can be used to map between reference genomes.

minority_freq
-------------
Extract frequencies of minority variants from multiple samples. A region of interest is also supported.

pair_sequences
--------------
Compare sequences from a multiple sequence alignment from transmitter and recipient samples in order to determine the optimal matching of transmitters to recipients.

predict_num_reads
-----------------
Predict number of reads after quality preprocessing. 

remove_gaps_msa
---------------
Given a multiple sequence alignment, remove loci with a gap fraction above a certain threshold.
