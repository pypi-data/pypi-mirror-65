        ==========================================
        
        __pytrovich__ is a Python 3.6+ port of [petrovich library](https://github.com/petrovich) which inflects Russian names 
        to a given grammatical case. It supports first names, last names and middle names inflections.
        
        [petrovich-java](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-java) was the main inspiration.
        
        ## Installation
        Should be as simple as that
        ```bash
        pip install pytrovich
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from pytrovich.enums import NamePart, Gender, Case
        from pytrovich.maker import PetrovichDeclinationMaker
        
        maker = PetrovichDeclinationMaker()
        print(maker.make(NamePart.FIRSTNAME, Gender.MALE, Case.GENITIVE, "Иван"))  # Ивана
        print(maker.make(NamePart.LASTNAME, Gender.MALE, Case.INSTRUMENTAL, "Иванов"))  # Ивановым
        print(maker.make(NamePart.MIDDLENAME, Gender.FEMALE, Case.DATIVE, "Ивановна"))  # Ивановне
        ```
        
        ### Custom rule file
        
        You can replace default rules file with some custom one. Only JSON format is supported.
        ```python
        maker = PetrovichDeclinationMaker("/path/to/custom/rules.file.json")
        ```
        E.g. if `pytrovich` fails on `PetrovichDeclinationMaker` creation, 
        one may consider downloading `rules.json` directly from 
        [petrovich-rules repo](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-rules) as a fix.
        
        ### More info
        
        For more info please refer to other [petrovich](https://github.com/petrovich/) repos.
        
        ### TODO
        
        - grammatical gender detection (given the name)
        - `How to cite us` section
