Using JupyterLab components
---------------------------

JupyterLab is built with many re-usable components that are
independently `published on npm <https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40jupyterlab>`_.
JupyterLab itself assembles these components together to provide a full,
IDE-like experience. However, developers are encouraged to use these to bring
to life their own visions of what a computational environment should look
like.

The JupyterLab repository has `many examples <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/examples>`_
to get you started.
