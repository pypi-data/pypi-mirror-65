Description: # GENERAL
        
        This is a set of C++-based Python extensions for the ManipulateAggregates
        software package (see <https://github.com/razziel89/ManipulateAggregates>).
        
        Please see the documentation for all detailed descriptions of libFireDeamon on
        <https://razziel89.github.io/libFireDeamon/> (provided via GitHub pages).
        Since we lack a good tool to document both Python and C++ code, both are
        documented separately.
        Doxygen is used for C++ whereas Sphinx is used for Python.
        The Python docs are available at:
        <https://razziel89.github.io/libFireDeamon/>.
        They link to the C++ documentation.
