Description: ==================================
         Media Keys on macOS High Sierra+
        ==================================
        
        This project is a version of `HighSierraMediaKeyEnabler`_ written in
        Python for simplicity using PyObjC.
        
        In short, it makes it so that Safari cannot steal the media keys: the
        media keys always control iTunes (Music on Catalina). (I usually have
        TweetDeck open in a Safari window, and if TweetDeck has tried to send
        a notification, Safari would grab the media keys to just replay the
        tweet sound; the only way to get them back to iTunes was to click the
        mouse---ugh!)
        
        Using
        =====
        
        After installing, you will have a command ``mediakeyenabler``. Run it.
        End it with Ctrl-C or sending the equivalent signal to the PID.
        
        Known Limitations
        =================
        
        - I don't use spotify, so this only supports iTunes.
        - I don't ever want it to start iTunes, so it only does anything if
          iTunes is already running.
        - I've never wanted to fast forward or rewind, only restart the track
          or go to the next one (in fact I didn't know FF and rewind were
          possible) so this program doesn't do that.
        - No GUI (at least not yet), it's just a command line program.
        
        Known Limitations in the Original
        =================================
        
        There are some known limitations in the original that this project
        inherites due to the basic design using a CGEventTap. Notably, certain
        operations cannot be done when the program is running:
        
        - Changing the Safari search engine (`issue 43`_)
        - Enabling kernel extensions (`issue 42`_)
        
        If those are fixed in the original, they might get fixed here.
