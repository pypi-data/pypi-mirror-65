# AARC G002 Entitlement Parser

# Introduction
This package provides a python Class to parse and compare entitlements according
to the AARC-G002 Recommendation https://aarc-project.eu/guidelines/aarc-g002.


# Example

```python
from aarc_g002_entitlement import Aarc_g002_entitlement

required = Aarc_g002_entitlement(
    'urn:geant:h-df.de:group:aai-admin',
    strict=False)
actual = Aarc_g002_entitlement(
    'urn:geant:h-df.de:group:aai-admin:role=member#backupserver.used.for.developmt.de')

# is a user with actual permitted to use a resource which needs required?
permitted = required.is_contained_in(actual) # True in this case

# are the two entitlements the same?
equals = required == actual # False in this case
```
