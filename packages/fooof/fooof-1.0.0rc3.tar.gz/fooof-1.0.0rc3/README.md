FOOOF is a fast, efficient, and physiologically-informed tool to parameterize neural power spectra.

Note: FOOOF is currently on a pre-release. Please check the install instructions for
updating to the pre-release version, and check the
[changelog](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/changelog.html)
for how to get started with the new version.

## Overview

FOOOF conceives of a model of the power spectrum as a combination of two distinct functional processes:
- An aperiodic component, reflecting 1/f like characteristics, with
- A variable number of periodic components (putative oscillations), as peaks rising above the aperiodic component

This model driven approach can be used to measure periodic and aperiodic properties of electrophysiological data,
including EEG, MEG, ECoG and LFP data.

The benefit of using FOOOF for measuring putative oscillations, is that peaks in the power spectrum are
characterized in terms of their specific center frequency, power and bandwidth without requiring predefining
specific bands of interest and controlling for the aperiodic component.
FOOOF also gives you a measure of this aperiodic components of the signal, allowing for measuring and
comparison of 1/f-like components of the signal within and between subjects.

## Dependencies

FOOOF is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.5 to run.

It has the following required dependencies:
- [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
- [scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy) >= 0.19

There are also optional dependencies, which are not required for model fitting itself, but offer extra functionality:
- [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) is needed to visualize data and model fits
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is needed to print progress bars when fitting many models
- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) is needed to run the test suite locally

We recommend using the [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) distribution to manage these requirements.

## Installation

**Pre-Release Version**

To install the current pre-release version, use pip:

`$ pip install fooof --pre`

If you already have a version of FOOOF installed, you will need to remove it first:

`$pip uninstall fooof`

**Stable Version**

To install the latest stable release, use pip:

`$ pip install fooof`

Note that this will install only the core (non-optional) FOOOF requirements.

**Development Version**

To get the current development version, first clone this repository:

`$ git clone https://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof`

To install this cloned copy, move into the directory you just cloned, and run:

`$ pip install .`

**Editable Version**

To install an editable version, download the development version as above, and run:

`$ pip install -e .`

## Matlab Support

FOOOF is implemented in Python, but there is also Matlab wrapper that allows you to use FOOOF from Matlab.
The wrapper is available in the
[fooof_mat](http://github.com/fooof-tools/fooof_mat) repository.

If you would like to use FOOOF, from Python, within a pipeline that is mostly in Matlab, the
[mat_py_mat](https://github.com/fooof-tools/mat_py_mat)
repository also has some examples and utilities for doing so.

## Quickstart

FOOOF is object oriented, and uses a similar approach as used in scikit-learn.

The algorithm works on frequency representations, that is power spectra in linear space.

**Fitting a Single Power Spectrum**

With a power spectrum loaded (with 'freqs' storing frequency values, and 'spectrum' storing
the power spectrum, both as 1D arrays in linear space) FOOOF can be used as follows:

```python
from fooof import FOOOF

# Initialize FOOOF object
fm = FOOOF()

# Define frequency range across which to model the spectrum
freq_range = [3, 40]

# Model the power spectrum with FOOOF, and print out a report
fm.report(freqs, spectrum, freq_range)
```

FOOOF.report() fits the model, plots the original power spectrum with the associated FOOOF model fit,
and prints out the parameters of the model fit for both the aperiodic component, and parameters for
any identified peaks, reflecting periodic components.

Example output for the report of a FOOOF fit on an individual power spectrum:

!["fooof_report"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fooof-tools/fooof/master/doc/img/FOOOF_report.png)

**Defining the model Settings**

FOOOF also has some settings for the algorithm.

These settings are:
* `peak_width_limits` sets the possible lower- and upper-bounds for the fitted peak widths.
* `max_n_peaks` sets the maximum number of peaks to fit.
* `min_peak_height` sets an absolute limit on the minimum height (above aperiodic) for any extracted peak.
* `peak_threshold` sets a relative threshold above which a peak height must cross to be included in the model.
* `aperiodic_mode` defines the approach to use to parameterize the aperiodic component.

These settings can be defined when initializing the model, for example:
```python
fm = FOOOF(peak_width_limits=[1.0, 8.0], max_n_peaks=6, min_peak_height=0.1,
           peak_threshold=2.0, aperiodic_mode='fixed')
```

**Fitting a Group of Power Spectra**

Next is an example workflow for fitting a group of neural power spectra.
In this case, 'freqs' is again a 1D array of frequency values, and 'spectra' as a 2D array of power spectra.
We can fit this  which can be fit as:

```python

# Initialize a FOOOFGroup object, specifying some parameters
fg = FOOOFGroup(peak_width_limits=[1.0, 8.0], max_n_peaks=8)

# Fit FOOOF model across the matrix of power spectra
fg.fit(freqs, spectra)

# Create and save out a report summarizing the results across the group of power spectra
fg.save_report()

# Save out FOOOF results for further analysis later
fg.save(file_name='fooof_group_results', save_results=True)
```

Example output from using FOOOFGroup across a group of power spectra:

!["fooof_group_report"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fooof-tools/fooof/master/doc/img/FOOOFGroup_report.png)

**Other Functionality**

FOOOF also has functionality for running the FOOOF model across matrices of multiple power spectra,
saving and loading results, creating reports from FOOOF outputs, analyzing model outputs,
plotting models and parameters, and simulating power spectra, all of which is described in the
[documentation](https://fooof-tools.github.io/fooof/).
