ARA Records Ansible
===================
.. image:: doc/source/_static/ara-with-icon.png

ARA Records Ansible playbook runs and makes the recorded data available and
intuitive for users and systems.

ARA doesn't run your playbooks for you: it integrates with Ansible as a
callback plugin wherever it is.

Whether you are running Ansible from your personal laptop or a server, all
you need to do is to `install ARA`_, `configure Ansible to use ARA`_ and
you're good to go.

.. _install ARA: https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/stable-0.x/installation.html
.. _configure Ansible to use ARA: https://ara.readthedocs.io/en/stable-0.x/configuration.html

Quickstart
==========

::

    # Install ARA
    pip install ara

    # Load environment variables that inform Ansible to use ARA regardless
    # of its location or python version
    source <(python -m ara.setup.env)

    # Run your Ansible playbook or commands
    # ansible-playbook myplaybook.yml

    # Start the ARA standalone webserver
    ara-manage runserver
    # Browse http://127.0.0.1:9191

Refer to the documentation_ for more information.

ARA components
==============

ARA has four main components:

1. An `Ansible callback plugin`_ to record playbook runs into a local or remote database
2. The ara_record_ and ara_read_ pair of Ansible modules to record and read persistent data with ARA
3. A `CLI client`_ to query the database
4. A `dynamic, database-driven web interface`_ that can also be `generated and served from static files`_

What does the web interface look like ?
---------------------------------------

A video preview and explanation of the web interface is available on
YouTube_, featuring playbook runs from the OpenStack-Ansible_ project.
