Description: # pcap2map
        ### Place IP's from PCAP on world map
        
        This package enables a user to specify a network traffic file (i.e. 
        a packet capture or .pcap file), extract the IP addresses from that
        file, geo-locate those addresses using a built-in database, and 
        then place those IP's on a world map (a .png file).
        
        Notes:
        * The geolocation is done via a database provided by IP2Location.com. The database is included as part of the package.
        * Only public IP's are extracted
        * Typical runtime is 10 seconds for a small .pcap file
        * There are many pre-existing packages that geo-locate IP's but none that extract IP's from a .pcap. pcap2map solves the latter problem
        * pcap2map was written to be cross-platform
        * pcap2map was written with Python 3.7
        
        Dependencies:
        * Wireshark - pyshark, a Python packet parsing module, relies on Wireshark. Wireshark download instructions can be found [here](https://tshark.dev/setup/install/)
        * orca - The visualization and mapping of the geo-located IP addresses relies on plotly, to include a package called orca. Orca ownload instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/plotly/orca)
        
        ## Installation instructions
