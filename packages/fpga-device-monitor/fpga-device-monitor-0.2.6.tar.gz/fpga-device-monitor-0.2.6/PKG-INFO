Description: # fpga_device_monitor
        A GUI for remotely controlling a Smart Home FPGA solution that was created as part of a Bachelor's thesis.
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install fpga-device-monitor
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        To run the monitor on a device with I2C support and a connected Smart Home FPGA:
        ```
        python -m fpga_device_monitor
        ```
        
        To run with simulated dummy devices, run instead:
        ```
        python -m fpga_device_monitor --dummy
        ```
        
        Use `--bus` and `--addr` to adjust I2C bus number and FPGA device address, respectively. See `--help`.
