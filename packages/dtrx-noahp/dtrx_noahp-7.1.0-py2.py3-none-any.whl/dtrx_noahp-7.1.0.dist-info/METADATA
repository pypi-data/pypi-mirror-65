dtrx extracts archives in a number of different
formats; it currently supports tar, zip (including self-extracting
.exe files), cpio, rpm, deb, gem, 7z, cab, rar, lzh, arj, and
InstallShield files.  It can also decompress files compressed with gzip,
bzip2, lzma, xz, lrzip, lzip, or compress.

In addition to providing one command to handle many different archive
types, dtrx also aids the user by extracting contents consistently.
By default, everything will be written to a dedicated directory
that's named after the archive.  dtrx will also change the
permissions to ensure that the owner can read and write all those
files.
