# pterm

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pterm.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/pterm)



Generates a bunch of usefull iterm2 dynamic profiles



It will load your ~/.aws/config and will generate all the required profiles

for your aws accounts.



It can handle things like `source_profile` or `aws-azure-login` and it will

automatically export the correct `AWS_PROFILE` env var along with a cool badge

for your session.



But wait, there is more.



This script also talks kubernetes. It will scan your ~/.kube/confing and will

separate it out to multiple files. When you launch a k8s profile, the correct

`KUBECOFNIG` and `AWS_PROFILE` is set, plus you get a nice blue color to make

sure you know you are in a k8s enabled environment.
