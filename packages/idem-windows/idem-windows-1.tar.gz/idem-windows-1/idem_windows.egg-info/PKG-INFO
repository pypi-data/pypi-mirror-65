        POP_WINDOWS
        ***********
        **Grains, execution modules, and state modules common to all windows systems**
        
        INSTALLATION
        ============
        
        
        Pip install grains::
        
            pip install -e git+https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/grains.git#egg=chunkies
        
        Clone the `pop_windows` repo and install with pip::
        
            git clone https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop_windows.git
            pip install -e pop_windows
        
        EXECUTION
        =========
        After installation the `grains` command should now be available
        
        TESTING
        =======
        install `requirements-test.txt` with pip and run pytest::
        
            pip install -r pop_windows\requirements-test.txt
            pytest pop_windows\tests
        
        VERTICAL APP-MERGING
        ====================
        Instructions for extending pop-windows into an OS or distro specific pop project
        
        Install pop::
        
            pip install --upgrade pop
        
        Create a new directory for the project::
        
            mkdir pop_{specific_windows_system}
            cd pop_{specific_windows_system}
        
        
        Use `pop-seed` to generate the structure of a project that extends `grains` and `idem`::
        
            pop-seed -t v pop_{specific_windows_system} -d grains exec states
        
        * "-t v" specifies that this is a vertically app-merged project
        *  "-d grains exec states" says that we want to implement the dynamic names of "grains", "exec", and "states"
        
        Add "pop_windows" to the requirements.txt::
        
            echo "pop_windows @ git+https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop_windows.git" >> requirements.txt
        
        And that's it!  Go to town making grains, execution modules, and state modules specific to your unique windows system.
        Follow the conventions you see in pop_windows.
