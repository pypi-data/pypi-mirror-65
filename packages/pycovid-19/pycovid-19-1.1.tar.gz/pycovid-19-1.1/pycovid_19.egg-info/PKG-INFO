Description: # Pycovid-19
        
        COVID-19 Python plots and maps
        
        This small package allows for downloading and plotting
        covid-19 confirmed cases, recovered and deaths from data
        gathered by the [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
        It allows for country evolutions to be compared between
        them, as well as for prevalence to be calculated.
