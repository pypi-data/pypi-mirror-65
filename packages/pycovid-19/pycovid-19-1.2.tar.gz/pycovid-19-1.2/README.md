COVID-19 Python plots and maps

This small package allows for downloading and plotting
covid-19 confirmed cases, recovered and deaths from data
gathered by the [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
It allows for country evolutions to be compared between
them, as well as for prevalence to be calculated.
