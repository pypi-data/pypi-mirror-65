Description: # palace
        Palace is a Python 3D audio API wrapping around [alure].
        To quote alure's README,
        
        > It uses OpenAL for audio rendering, and provides common higher-level features
        > such as file loading and decoding, buffer caching, background streaming,
        > and source management for virtually unlimited sound source handles.
        
        ## Features
        In some sense, what palace aimes to be to [OpenAL Soft] is what [ModernGL]
        is to OpenGL (except that all the heavy-lifting are taken are by alure):
        
        * 3D sound rendering
        * Environmental audio effects: reverb, atmospheric air absorption,
          sound occlusion and obstruction
        * Binaural (HRTF) rendering
        * Out-of-the-box audio decoding of FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, Opus, WAV, AIFF, etc.
        * Modern Pythonic API: snake_case, `@property`, `with` context manager,
          type annotation
        
        ## Installation
        ### Prerequisites
        Palace requires Python 3.6+ for runtime and [pip] for installation.
        
        ### Via PyPI
        Palace can be install from the [Python Package Index][PyPI] via simply
        
            pip install palace
        
        Wheel distributions are only built for GNU/Linux and macOS on amd64
        at the time of writing.  If you want to help out, please head to
        GitHub issue [#1][GH-1].
        
        *Note:  [Wheels built for macOS have yet to include shared libraries][GH-63],
        so it still requires [alure] and its dependencies to be installed.*
        
        ### From source
        Aside from the build dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`, one will
        additionally need compatible Python headers, [alure], a C++14 compiler,
        [CMake] 2.6+ (and probably `git` for fetching the source).
        Palace can then be compiled and installed by running
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/McSinyx/palace
        
        ## Usage
        One may start with the `examples` for sample usage of palace.
        For further information, Python's `help` is your friend.
        
        ## License and Credits
        Palace is released under the [GNU LGPL version 3 or later][LGPLv3+].
        
        To ensure that palace can run without any dependencies outside of the [pip]
        toolchain, the wheels are bundled with dynamically linked libraries from
        the build machine, which is similar to static linking:
