# Project Goals
This project provides Python package for managing [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/) instances through their entire life cycle.  
It can be useful for setting up [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) challenges or various [labs (be it home or development)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) to provide access to separated network or [VLANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN).
