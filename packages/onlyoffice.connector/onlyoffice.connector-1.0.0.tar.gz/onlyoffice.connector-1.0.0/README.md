## Features

The plugin allows to:

* Create and edit text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations.
* Share documents with other users.
* Co-edit documents in real-time: use two co-editing modes (Fast and Strict), Track Changes, comments, and built-in chat.

* For viewing only: PDF, ODT, ODS, ODP, DOC, XLS, PPT.

## Installing ONLYOFFICE Document Server

You will need an instance of ONLYOFFICE Document Server that is resolvable and connectable both from Plone and any end-clients. ONLYOFFICE Document Server must also be able to POST to Plone directly.

You can install free Community version of ONLYOFFICE Document Server or scalable enterprise-level Integration Edition.

To install free Community version, use [Docker](https://github.com/onlyoffice/Docker-DocumentServer) (recommended) or follow [these instructions](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/linux/document/linux-installation.aspx) for Debian, Ubuntu, or derivatives.  

To install Integration Edition, follow instructions [here](https://helpcenter.onlyoffice.com/server/integration-edition/index.aspx).

Community Edition vs Integration Edition comparison can be found [here](#onlyoffice-document-server-editions).

## Installing Plone ONLYOFFICE integration plugin

Install plugin by adding it to your `buildout.cfg`:

```
[buildout]

...

eggs =
    onlyoffice.connector
```

and then running `bin/buildout`

To enable plugin, go to `Site Setup` -> `Add-ons`and press the `Install` button.

## Configuring Plone ONLYOFFICE integration plugin

To configure plugin go to `Site Setup`. Scroll down to `Add-ons Configuration` section and press the `ONLYOFFICE Configuration` button.

## How it works

The ONLYOFFICE integration follows the API documented [here](https://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/basic):

* User navigates to a document within Plone and selects the `ONLYOFFICE Edit` action.
* Plone prepares a JSON object for the Document Server with the following properties:
  * **url**: the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server uses to download the document;
  * **callbackUrl**: the URL that ONLYOFFICE Document Server informs about status of the document editing;
  * **key**: the UUID+Modified Timestamp to instruct ONLYOFFICE Document Server whether to download the document again or not;
  * **title**: the document Title (name).
* Plone constructs a page from a `.pt` template, filling in all of those values so that the client browser can load up the editor.
* The client browser makes a request for the javascript library from ONLYOFFICE Document Server and sends ONLYOFFICE Document Server the docEditor configuration with the above properties.
* Then ONLYOFFICE Document Server downloads the document from Plone and the user begins editing.
* ONLYOFFICE Document Server sends a POST request to the `callback` URL to inform Plone that a user is editing the document.
* When all users and client browsers are done with editing, they close the editing window.
* After 10 seconds of inactivity, ONLYOFFICE Document Server sends a POST to the `callback` URL letting Plone know that the clients have finished editing the document and closed it.
* Plone downloads the new version of the document, replacing the old one.

## Developing Plone ONLYOFFICE plugin

- Clone repository and change directory

```
git clone --branch deploy git@github.com:ONLYOFFICE/onlyoffice-plone.git
cd onlyoffice-plone
```

 - Create a virtualenv in the package
 - Install requirements with pip
 - Run buildout

```
virtualenv --clear .
./bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
./bin/buildout
```

 - Start Plone in foreground

```
./bin/instance fg
```

Note that Plone is based on Zope server and will not run as `root` user. If you intend to run it as `root` user. You must supply [effective-user directive](https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/2.12/SETUID.html). In order to do so add `effective-user <username>` line to `./parts/instance/etc/zope.conf`.
