Description: # print_schema
        
        Ever had a complex Python object and wanted to easily see its structure?
        
        **print_schema** makes it super easy to *display the structure* of complex dictionaries, JSONs, lists, etc
        It differs from pprint in that this displays the structure rather than the object itself.
        
        *New:* Use **print_matrix** to display a 2D array (list of lists) in the matrix form.
        
        ## Installing
        
        You can download this package from pip:
        ```
        pip install print-schema
        ```
        
        ### How to use this package
        
        ```
        from print_schema import print_schema
        my_dict = {"bts": {"members": 7,
                           "bias": "Kim Tae-hyung",
                           "albums": {"first": "Dark & Wild",
                                      "peak_chart_position": {"Japan": 30, "Korea": 2},
                                      "favorite_songs": ["Blood Sweat and Tears", "Boy with luv"]},

                           (2, 3): "a random tuple"},
                   "beatles": {"members": 4,
                               "bias": "George Harrisom",
                               "albums": {"first": "Please Please Me",
                                          "peak_chart_position": {"UK": 1, "France": 5, "Germany": 5},
                                          "favorite_songs": ["Eleanor Rigby", "While My Guitar Gently Weeps"]},
                               "more_members_alive_than_dead": False,
                               (4, 5): "another random tuple"}}
        print_schema(my_dict, indent=3, dense=False)
        ```

        ### Display a list of lists as a matrix
        New in version 1.1
        ```
        from print_schema import print_matrix
        my_arr = [[11, 312, None, 2],
                  [93, -45, 10],
                  [-100.3, 8, 192, 5],
                  [55, 1.5, 854, 6]]
        print_matrix(my_arr, index=True)
        ```

        This project started when I started looking for a native Python equivalent of PySpark/Scala's printSchema() and couldn't find any :)
        
        Much thanks to my favorite after-hours colleague Puneet Jindal for all the help.
