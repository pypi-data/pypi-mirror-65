Description: # *obf* - an obfuscation tool and library
        
        *obf* is designed to obfuscate an input document, whilst ensuring that the output is still (somewhat) human-readable and 
        while also maintaining consistency of mapping between an input plaintext and an obfuscated output, such that 
        obf(plaintext) always yields the same result.
        
        This latter characteristic means that *obf* is not really suitable for strong encryption, as frequency analysis of the 
        output ciphertext, perhaps with the assistance of a crib, could make the output comprehensible to an attacker.
        
        The intent of *obf* is to allow the sharing of potentially sensitive data outside of a protected zone while ensuring 
        it's continued consistency, and thus operability without requiring any changes to other tools and tooling.
        
        *obf* was developed as a tool to allow the copying of data (files and databases) from a protected "green" network to 
        unprotected "red" zones, including developer workstations and laptops while maintaining reasonable data privacy. *obf* 
        is intended to be used either as a standalone tool or as a library in an automated data-copy process.  
        
        **Installation instructions**
        -----------------------------
        *obf* is written in Python, and you can use the pip installer to install it thus:
        
        ```
        $ pip install obf
        ```
        
        **Usage**
        ---------
        ```
        obf [-h] [-b [blockedwords file]] [-w [codewords file]] [-c]
                              [-n [N]] [-e [E]] [-a [ALGO]] [-s [SALT]] [-l] [-v]
                              [plaintext]
        
        ```
        
        #### positional arguments:
        
          ```plaintext```       A plaintext to obfuscate. If no plaintext is provided,
                                then obf will look at stdin instead.
        
        #### optional arguments:
        
        ```-h, --help```        Show this help message and exit
          
        ```-b [blockedwords file]```
                                A file containing specific words to block. If missing
                                the entire input is obfuscated.
                                
        ```-w [codewords file]```
                                A file containing code words to use.
          
        ```-c ```               Display a crib showing the mapping of blocked values
                                to their obfuscated values. Only works when a specific
                                blockfile is used with the -b option.
                                
        ```-n [N]```            An index to indicate which bytes of the generated hash
                                to use as a lookup into the codewords file. Defaults
                                to 0.
                                
        ```-e [E]```            A string of comma-separated domain name components
                                that should be exempt from obfuscation to aid
                                readability. Dots are not permitted/valid. Defaults to
                                'com,co,uk,org' and any that are specified on the
                                command line are added to this list.
                                
        ```-a [ALGO], --algo [ALGO]```
                                The hash algorithm to use as a basis for indexing the
                                codewords file; defaults to SHA256
                                
        ```-s [SALT], --salt [SALT]```
                                A salt for the hash function to ensure uniqueness of
                                encoding.
                                
        ```-l, --list-algos``` List available hash algorithms.
        
        ```-j [JSON], --json [JSON]```
                                Treat the input as JSON, and apply the obfuscation
                                rules to each of the fields/keys specified in this
                                space-delimited list
        
         
        ```-v ```               Verbose mode = show key parameters, etc
        
        
        
        
        **Examples**

        This is a sample file that holds some secrets. For example, both DREAMING and STIRRING are examples of a FRETS PEMMICAN.
