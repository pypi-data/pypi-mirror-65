         * You need to define your Whazzup API Key in ENV as `WHAZZUP_KEY`
         * Basic structure : 
         ```
        from ivao import Server
        
        server = Server()
        
        # You event handlers go here 
        
        server.run_update_stream()
        ``` 
        ### Examples 
         * Examples can be found the the [example.py](https://github.com/Tchekda/IVAOWrapper/blob/dev/example.py) file
         * Some personal scripts are located [Tchekda/IVAO-Utils](https://github.com/Tchekda/IVAO-Utils)
        
        
        ## Build
         - Master : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Tchekda/IVAOWrapper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Tchekda/IVAOWrapper)
         - Dev :  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Tchekda/IVAOWrapper.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.com/Tchekda/IVAOWrapper)
        
        You are free to open an issue if you have a problem, and welcome to make a PR to improve the wrapper
        
        Tested with some versions of Python 3.x, might work with newer ones.
         
        Tests with Python 3.4 aren't working but module should work
        ### Dev Requirements
         - `requests` to grab whazzup file
         - `pdoc3` to generate html documentation
        
        
        ## Events List
         * `update` : When new data is parsed, given with clients list
         * `connect` : When a client connects to the network, given with client type object
         * `disconnect` : When a client disconnects from the network, given with client type object
         * `atis_update` : When an ATC updates ATIS, given with ATC object
         * `takeoff` : When a pilot takeoff, given with pilot object
         * `land` : When a pilot lands, given with pilot object
         * `static` : When pilot's position didn't changed since last update, given with pilot object
         * `moving` : When pilot's position changed since last update, given with pilot object
         * `cruise` : When pilot's altitude didn't change by +/- 1000ft since last update, given with pilot object
         * `climb` : When pilot's altitude increased by more than 1000ft since last update, given with pilot object
         * `descent` : When pilot's altitude decreased by more than 1000ft since last update, given with pilot object
         
         Function name doesn't need to match the event name, only the event handler need to have the exact event name
