Description: # Xontrib-ssh-agent
        
        Ssh-agent xonsh integration.
        
        ## Install
        
        Install using pip
        
        ```
        pip install xontrib-ssh-agent
        ```
        
        Add to your `.xonshrc`:
        
        ```
        xontrib load ssh_agent
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        This xontrib launches `ssh-agent` when `xonsh` is started if it isn't already running, and sets the required environment variables.
        
        By issuing the `ssh` command it checks for added identities, and if there's none it adds them via the `ssh-add` command.
        
        ### `git` support
        
        To handle ssh identities, [repassh](https://github.com/dyuri/repassh) is used under the hood. If it's on the `$PATH`, `xontrib-ssh-agent` sets `$GIT_SSH` to it by default. If your `repassh` command is not on the `$PATH` by default, but you still want to use it for git, then set `$GIT_SSH` to it manually, or set `$REPASSH_COMMAND` before you load this xontrib.
