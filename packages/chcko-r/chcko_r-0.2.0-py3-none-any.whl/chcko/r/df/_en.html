<!-- html --><p>As I was about to engage in a teaching job in the beginning of 2013 I was
looking for a way adequate for our times</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>to follow the progress of my students</p></li>
<li><p>to automate certain activities</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I did not find a finished solution fitting to my ideas,
but I found Google Appengine, which seemed to be a good basis for an own project.</p>
<p>During my teaching job it was still in a very unsophisticated state,
but it was usable already. During that time I added mostly exercises, some summaries
or other texts that did fit into the topics in class.</p>
<p>The name came about from this schoolâ€™s abbreviation of the subject mathematics as MAM.</p>
<p>Since summer 2013 I restructured the code and added user management
and I translated the exercises and texts into English.</p>
<p>Since in autumn I did not continue teaching,
my major motivation for the additional effort was to make my initial effort
usable for others.</p>
<p>So I hope</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>that other do agree with the basic idea and approach</p></li>
<li><p>that learners as well as teachers find the existing implementation usable</p></li>
<li><p>and that they use it and extend it</p></li>
</ul>
