Documentation for the OfflineImap Test suite.

How to run the tests
====================

- Copy the credentials.conf.sample to credentials.conf and insert
  credentials for an IMAP account and a Gmail account. Delete the Gmail
  section if you don't have a Gmail account. Do note, that the tests
  will change the account and upload/delete/modify it's contents and
  folder structure. So don't use a real used account here...

- go to the top level dir (one above this one) and execute:
  'python setup.py test'

System requirements
===================

This test suite depend on python>=2.7 to run out of the box. If you want to run this with python 2.6 you will need to install the backport from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2 instead.
