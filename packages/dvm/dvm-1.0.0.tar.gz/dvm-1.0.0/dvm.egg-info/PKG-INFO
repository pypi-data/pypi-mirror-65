Description: ## The Discrete Voter Model
        
        The Discrete Voter Model is a method of ecological inference that grew out of [Hakeem Angulu's](https://github.com/hangulu) undergraduate [thesis](https://github.com/hangulu/thesis) for the departments of Computer Science and Statistics at Harvard College.
        
        This new method of solving the ecological inference problem, using a mixture of contemporary statistical computing techniques, is implemented here. It can be used for multiple racial groups and candidates, and is shown to work well on randomly-generated mock election data.
        
        The requirements can be installed with the included `Pipfile`. Go [here](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/) or [here](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/) for more information on how to use `Pipenv`.
