FISSA
=====

FISSA (Fast Image Signal Separation Analysis) is a Python library for
decontaminating somatic signals from two-photon calcium imaging data. It
can read images in tiff format and ROIs in zips as exported by ImageJ;
or operate with numpy arrays directly, which can be produced by
importing files stored in other formats.

For details of the algorithm, please see our `companion
paper <https://www.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-21640-2>`__ published in
Scientific Reports. For the code used to generate the simulated data
in the companion paper, see the
`SimCalc repository <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/SimCalc/>`__.

FISSA is compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5+. Using Python 3
is strongly encouraged, as Python 2 will no longer be `maintained
starting January 2020 <https://python3statement.org/>`__.

FISSA has been tested on Ubuntu 17.04 and on Windows Windows 10 with the
`Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux>`__ distribution.

Documentation, including the full API, is available online at
`<https://fissa.readthedocs.io>`_.

If you encounter a specific problem please `open a new
issue <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/issues/new>`__. For
general discussion and help with installation or setup, please see the
`Gitter chat <https://gitter.im/rochefort-lab/fissa>`__.

Usage
-----

A general tutorial on the use of FISSA can be found at:
https://rochefort-lab.github.io/fissa/examples/Basic%20usage.html

An example workflow with another Python toolbox (SIMA):
https://rochefort-lab.github.io/fissa/examples/SIMA%20example.html

An example workflow importing data exported from a MATLAB toolbox
(cNMF):
https://rochefort-lab.github.io/fissa/examples/cNMF%20example.html

These notebooks can also be run on your own machine. To do so, you will
need to `download a copy of the
repository <https://github.com/rochefort-lab/fissa/archive/master.zip>`__,
unzip it and browse to the `examples <examples>`__ directory. Then,
start up a jupyter notebook server to run our notebooks. If you're new
to jupyter notebooks, an approachable tutorial can be found at
https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook.

Installation
------------

Installation on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Basic prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download and install, in the following order:

-  (for Python 2.7 only) Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7:
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266

-  Python 2.7 or 3.5+ (recommended) Anaconda as the Python environment,
   available from https://www.anaconda.com/download/.

Installing FISSA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open ``Anaconda Prompt.exe``, which can be found through the Windows
start menu or search, and type or copy-paste (by right clicking) the
following:

::

    conda install -c conda-forge shapely tifffile

Then, install FISSA by running the command

::

    pip install fissa

You can check to see if FISSA is installed by running the command

::

    python -c "import fissa; print(fissa.__version__)"

You will see your FISSA version number printed in the terminal.

If you want to use the interactive plotting from the notebooks, you
should also install the HoloViews plotting toolbox, as follows

::

    conda install -c ioam holoviews

See `usage <#usage>`__ above for details on how to use FISSA.

Installation on Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing FISSA, you will need to make sure you have all of its
dependencies (and the dependencies of its dependencies) installed.

Here we will outline how to do all of these steps, assuming you already
have both Python and pip installed. It is highly likely that your Linux
distribution ships with these.

Dependencies of dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  `scipy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scipy/>`__ requires a `Fortran
   compiler and
   BLAS/LAPACK/ATLAS <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/building/linux.html#installation-from-source>`__.

-  `shapely <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`__ requires GEOS.

-  `Pillow <https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/>`__>=3.0.0 effectively
   requires a JPEG library.

These packages can be installed on *Debian/Ubuntu* with the following
shell commands.

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapack-dev libatlas-dev libatlas-base-dev
    sudo apt-get install libgeos-dev
    sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev

Installing FISSA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For normal usage of FISSA, you can install the latest release version on
PyPI using pip:

::

    pip install fissa

To also install fissa along with the dependencies required to run our
sample notebooks (which include plots rendered with holoviews) you
should run the following command:

::

    pip install fissa['plotting']

You can check to see if FISSA is installed by running the command

::

    python -c "import fissa; print(fissa.__version__)"

You will see your FISSA version number printed in the terminal.
