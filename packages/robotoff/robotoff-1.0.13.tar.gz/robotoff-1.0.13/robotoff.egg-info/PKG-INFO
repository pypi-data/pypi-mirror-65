Description: # Robotoff
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openfoodfacts/robotoff.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openfoodfacts/robotoff)
        
        Robotoff is a service managing potential Open Food Facts updates (also known as _insights_).
        These insights include a growing set of facts, including:
        - the product category, weight, brand, packager codes and expiration date
        - some of its labels
        - abusive pictures (selfies)
        - rotated pictures
        - ingredient spellchecking
        
        Robotoff provides an API to:
        
        - import a batch of insights in JSONL format
        - Fetch insights
        - Annotate an insight (accept or reject) and send the update to Openfoodfacts if the insight was accepted
        
        Once generated, the insights can be applied automatically, or after a manual validation if needs be.
        A scheduler takes care of regularly marking insights for automatic annotation and for sending the update to Openfoodfacts.
        
        The [API documentation](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/robotoff/blob/master/doc/api.md) describes the API endpoints.
