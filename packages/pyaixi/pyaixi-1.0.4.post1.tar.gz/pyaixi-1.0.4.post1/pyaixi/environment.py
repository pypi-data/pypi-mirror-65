class Environment:
    """ Base class for the various agent environments.

        Each individual environment should inherit from this class and implement the appropriate methods.

        In particular, the constructor should set up the environment as appropriate, including
        setting the initial observation and reward, as well as setting appropriate
        values for the configuration options:
         - `agent-actions`
         - `observation-bits`
         - `reward-bits`

        Following this, the agent and environment interact in a cyclic fashion. The
        agent receives the observation and reward using `Environment.getObservation`
        and `Environment.getReward` before supplying the environment with an action
        via `Environment.performAction`.

        Upon receiving an action, the environment updates the observation and reward.
        At the beginning of each cycle, the value of `Environment::isFinished` is checked.

        If it is true then there is no more interaction between the agent and environment,
        and the program exits. Otherwise the interaction continues indefinitely.
