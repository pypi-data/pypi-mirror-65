        =======
        
        pycatia was primarily created to access the CATIA API Measurable
        object and it's methods without the need of visual basic / CATScripts.
        There is further functionaliy available which can be seen by looking at
        the examples provided and reading the API at pycatia.readthedocs.io_.
        
        
        Some of the methods can be accessed simply using the pywin32 module but further 
        access to methods such as GetCOG do not seem to be accessible using pure python.
        There are several questions on stack overflow and the pywin32 mailing list regarding
        this. But, they fail to provide any working examples with the VB Measurable object 
        in python. 
        
        pycatia accesses these methods by running VBA scripts using the 
        `Dispatch('CATIA.Application').SystemService.Evaluate()` function where required
        and passing a small public function to it. Otherwise, pycatia uses the VB method
        directly but exposes it within the same python class.
        
        This has currently only been tested in CATIA V5 R21.

        Asking Questions
        ----------------
        
        Please don't raise an issue here until you have read the documentation, understood and met the requirements (YOU NEED
        CATIA INSTALLED) and have run the examples.
        
        If you are upgrading from an earlier versions and your scripts break please check the changelog to give you clues on
        what to do to resolve those issues.
        
        Once you have done that please give as much information as you can so I may
        try and reproduce the issue. Please provide the following information:
        
        * Windows OS version
        * CATIA version
        * Python version
        * pycatia version
        * Your code!
        * Full stack trace of error you encounter (properly formatted text please, not picture).
        
        Thanks! :-)
