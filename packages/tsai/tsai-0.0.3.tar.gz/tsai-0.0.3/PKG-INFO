        > Practical Deep Learning for Time Series / Sequential Data library based on fastai v2/ Pytorch.
        
        
        `tsai`is a deep learning library built on top of fastai v2 / Pytorch focused on state-of-the-art methods for time series classification and regression.
        
        ## Install
        
        You can install the **latest stable** version from pip:
        
        `pip install tsa`
        
        Or you can install the **bleeding edge** version of this library from github by doing:
        
        `pip install git+https://github.com/timeseriesAI/timeseriesAI.git@master`
        
        In the latter case, you may also want to use install the bleeding egde fastai & fastcore libraries, in which case you need to do this:
        
        `pip install git+https://github.com/fastai/fastcore.git@master`
        
        `pip install git+https://github.com/fastai/fastai2.git@master`
        
        ## How to use
        
        The only thing you need to do after you have installed the library is to add this to your notebook:
        
        `from tsai.all import *`
