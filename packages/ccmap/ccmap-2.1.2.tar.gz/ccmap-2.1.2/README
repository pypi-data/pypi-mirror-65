This package was designed as a tool to quickly compute thousands of sets of 
atomic or residue molecular contacts. The contacts can be evaluated inside a 
single body or across two bodies. The library scales well, with the support of 
native python multi-threading. We provided docking poses evaluation by the application 
of triplets of euler angles and translation vectors to initial unbound conformations.
