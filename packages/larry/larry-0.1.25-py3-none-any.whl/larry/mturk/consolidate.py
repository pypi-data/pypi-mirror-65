    Retrieves Worker responses for a HITId and computes a consolidated answer based on a simple plurality of responses.
    For example, if the HIT has 3 Assignments, and Workers respond with responses of A, A, and B, the resulting
    response would be A since 66.7% of Workers agree on a response of A which is higher than the default threshold of
    60%. If the threshold were set at 80% than None would be returned. Similarly, if Workers responded with A, B, and C,
    the result would be None since none of the answers received 60% of responses. By default, Assignments that have
    already been rejected are ignored for purposes of scoring responses.
