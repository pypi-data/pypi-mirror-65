## Amazon Kinesis Construct Library

<!--BEGIN STABILITY BANNER-->---


![Stability: Experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-Experimental-important.svg?style=for-the-badge)

> **This is a *developer preview* (public beta) module.**
>
> All classes with the `Cfn` prefix in this module ([CFN Resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/constructs.html#constructs_lib))
> are auto-generated from CloudFormation. They are stable and safe to use.
>
> However, all other classes, i.e., higher level constructs, are under active development and subject to non-backward
> compatible changes or removal in any future version. These are not subject to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) model.
> This means that while you may use them, you may need to update your source code when upgrading to a newer version of this package.

[Amazon Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html) provides collection and processing of large
[streams](https://aws.amazon.com/streaming-data/) of data records in real time. Kinesis data streams can be used for rapid and continuous data
intake and aggregation.

## Streams

Amazon Kinesis Data Streams ingests a large amount of data in real time, durably stores the data, and makes the data available for consumption.

Using the CDK, a new Kinesis stream can be created as part of the stack using the construct's constructor. You may specify the `streamName` to give
your own identifier to the stream. If not, CloudFormation will generate a name.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Stream(self, "MyFirstStream",
    stream_name="my-awesome-stream"
)
```

You can also specify properties such as `shardCount` to indicate how many shards the stream should choose and a `retentionPeriod`
to specify how long the data in the shards should remain accessible.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Stream(self, "MyFirstStream",
    stream_name="my-awesome-stream",
    shard_count=3,
    retention_period=Duration.hours(48)
)
```

### Encryption

[Stream encryption](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-kinesis-stream-streamencryption.html) enables
server-side encryption using an AWS KMS key for a specified stream.

Encryption is enabled by default on your stream with the master key owned by Kinesis Data Streams in regions where it is supported.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream")
```

You can enable encryption on your stream with a user-managed key by specifying the `encryption` property.
A KMS key will be created for you and associated with the stream.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=StreamEncryption.KMS
)
```

You can also supply your own external KMS key to use for stream encryption by specifying the `encryptionKey` property.

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
import aws_cdk.aws_kms as kms

key = kms.Key(self, "MyKey")

Stream(self, "MyEncryptedStream",
    encryption=StreamEncryption.KMS,
    encryption_key=key
)
```

### Import

Any Kinesis stream that has been created outside the stack can be imported into your CDK app.

Streams can be imported by their ARN via the `Stream.fromStreamArn()` API

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
stack = Stack(app, "MyStack")

imported_stream = Stream.from_stream_arn(stack, "ImportedStream", "arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-2:123456789012:stream/f3j09j2230j")
```

Encrypted Streams can also be imported by their attributes via the `Stream.fromStreamAttributes()` API

```python
# Example automatically generated without compilation. See https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/826
from aws_cdk.aws_kms import Key

stack = Stack(app, "MyStack")

imported_stream = Stream.from_stream_attributes(stack, "ImportedEncryptedStream",
    stream_arn="arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-2:123456789012:stream/f3j09j2230j",
    encryption_key=kms.Key.from_key_arn("arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012")
)
```
