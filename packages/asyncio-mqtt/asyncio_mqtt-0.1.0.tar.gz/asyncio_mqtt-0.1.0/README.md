# MQTT client with idiomatic asyncio interface üôå

Write code like this:

```python
async with Client('test.mosquitto.org') as client:
    await client.subscribe('floors/#')

    async with client.filtered_messages('floors/+/humidity') as messages:
        async for message in messages:
            print(message.decode())
```

* No more callbacks! üëç
* No more return codes (welcome to the `MqttError`)
* Graceful disconnection (forget about `on_unsubscribe`, `on_disconnect`, etc.)
* Compatible with `async` code
* Did we mention no more callbacks?

asyncio-mqtt combines the stability of the time-proven [paho-mqtt](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) library with a modern, asyncio-based interface.

The whole thing is less than [250 lines of code](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/blob/master/asyncio_mqtt/client.py).

## Advanced use ‚ö°

Let's make the example from before more interesting:

```python
import asyncio
from random import randrange
from asyncio_mqtt import Client

async def log_filtered_messages(client, topic_filter):
    async with client.filtered_messages(topic_filter) as messages:
        async for message in messages:
            print(f'[topic_filter="{topic_filter}"]: {message.decode()}')

async def log_unfiltered_messages(client):
    async with client.unfiltered_messages() as messages:
        async for message in messages:
            print(f'[unfiltered]: {message.decode()}')

async def main():
    async with Client('test.mosquitto.org') as client:
        await client.subscribe('floors/#')

        # You can create any number of message filters
        asyncio.create_task(log_filtered_messages(client, 'floors/+/humidity'))
        asyncio.create_task(log_filtered_messages(client, 'floors/rooftop/#'))
        # üëâ Try to add more filters!

        # All messages that doesn't match a filter will get logged here
        asyncio.create_task(log_unfiltered_messages(client))

        # Publish a random value to each of these topics
        topics = [
            'floors/basement/humidity',
            'floors/rooftop/humidity',
            'floors/rooftop/illuminance',
            # üëâ Try to add more topics!
        ]
        while True:
            for topic in topics:
                message = randrange(100)
                print(f'[topic="{topic}"] Publishing message={message}')
                await client.publish(topic, message, qos=1)
                await asyncio.sleep(2)

asyncio.run(main())
```
