Description: # seg1d
        
        Automated one-dimensional subsequence segmentation
        
        
        ## Overview
        
        seg1d is an open-source python package for the automated segmentation and extraction of time series data using one or more reference sequences. The segmentation process allows users to apply various methods and parameters for the process through weighted reference features in a rolling correlation size-varying window. Correlations can be averaged across the references and a peak detection algorithm finds individual segments. Non-overlapping segments are identified and a clustering algorithm groups the most similar subsequence movements within the target. The package was developed for movement sciences but should be useful to anyone interested in extracting correlated subsequences from a dataset.

        ### Documentation
        
        Full Documentation Available Online: https://cadop.github.io/seg1d/
        
        
        ### Alternatives
        
        There are existing libraries that provide clustering and similarity measures for querying subseries data.

        ## Quickstart 
        
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        Currently tested on ``Python 3.8`` on Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10. (Should work on ``Python 3.6`` and above)
        
        Required Packages:
        
        ``numpy>=1.18``, ``scipy>=1.4.1``, ``sklearn>=0.22``, ``numba>=0.48``
        
        For documentation:
        
        ``sphinx>=2``
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```pip install seg1d```
        
        
        ### Example usage
        
        The documentation contains examples using data of both generated data (e.g., sine wave) and real-world examples (i.e., motion capture data). 
        
        To quickly get started, try importing the seg1d module and using the provided sample data. 
        
        ```python
        
        import seg1d 
        
        #retrieve the sample reference, target, and weight data
        r,t,w = seg1d.sampleData()
        # define scaling percentage and rolling step size
        minW, maxW, step  = 70, 150, 1 
        #call the segmentation algorithm
        seg1d.segmentData(r,t,w,minW,maxW,step)
        
        # Should output an array equal to:
        # array([[207.       , 240.       ,   0.9124224],
        #        [342.       , 381.       ,   0.8801901],
        #        [ 72.       , 112.       ,   0.8776795]])
        
        ```
