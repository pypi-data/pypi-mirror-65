        SINABS
        ======
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        **Sinabs Is Not A Brain Simulator**
        
        **NOTE**: This project is mirrored to gitlab.com/aiCTX/sinabs and is managed by aiCTX AG.
        
        `sinabs` (pytorch based library) is developed to design and implement Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs).
        The library implements several layers that are `spiking` equivalents of CNN layers.
        In addition it provides support to import CNN models implemented in keras conveniently to test their `spiking` equivalent implementation.
        
        **NOTE**: The conversion of CNNs to SCNNs is still a subject of research and we strive to keep the library updated to the state-of-the art in addition to providing options to compare various approaches both at a high level abstraction to low level implementation details.
        
        **NOTE**: This library is an alpha release state and is subject to API changes.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install `sinabs` with pip:
        
        ```
        pip install sinabs
        ```
        
        If you want to develop or have access to source code of sinabs, download the package from the git repository:
        
        ```
        $ cd <to/your/software/folder>
        $ git clone https://gitlab.com/aiCTX/sinabs.git>
        $ cd sinabs
        $ pip install -e . --user
        ```
        
        For developers, we recommend that you install this package as a development version so that you can update the package without reinstalling the package.

        If you would like to generate documentation locally, you can do that using `sphynx`.
        
        You can generate a sphynx documentation for this package by running the the following command.
        
        *Requirements*: sphinx, pandoc, nbsphinx
        
        ```
        $ cd /path/to/sinabs/docs/
        $ make html
        $ firefox build/html/index.html
        ```
        
        This will build and auto generate html documentation at `sinabs/docs/build/html/index.html`
