        # ballet-submit-labextension
        
        Submit ballet modules from within JupyterLab
        
        This extension is composed of a Python package named `ballet-submit-labextension`
        for the server extension and a NPM package also named `ballet-submit-labextension`
        for the frontend extension.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - JupyterLab >= 2.0
        
        ## Install
        
        ```bash
        pip install ballet-submit-labextension
        jupyter lab build
        ```
        
        Note: You will need NodeJS to install the extension; the installation process
        will complain if it is not found.
        
        ## Configure
        
        The extension ties into the same configuration system as Jupyter [Lab] itself.
        
        1. Determine the path to your jupyter config file (you may have to create it 
        if it does not exist):
        
            ```bash
            touch "$(jupyter --config-dir)/jupyter_notebook_config.py"
            ```
        
        2. Append the following config to the end of the file:
        
            ```python
            c.BalletApp.username = 'github username'
            c.BalletApp.token = 'github personal access token'
            ```
            
            You can optionally also configure the following:
            
            ```python
            c.BalletApp.useremail = 'email address to associate with git commit messages'
            c.BalletApp.debug = 'enable debug mode (no changes made on GitHub)'
            ```
        
        ## Troubleshoot
        
        If you are see the frontend extension but it is not working, check
        that the server extension is enabled:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter serverextension list
        ```
        
        If the server extension is installed and enabled but your not seeing
        the frontend, check the frontend is installed:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter labextension list
        ```
        
        If it is installed, try:
        
        ```bash
        jupyter lab clean
        jupyter lab build
        ```
        
        ## Contributing
        
        ### Development Install
        
        The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
        [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
        `yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.
        
        ```bash
        # Clone the repo to your local environment
        # Move to ballet-submit-labextension directory
        # Install server extension
        pip install -e .
        # Register server extension
        jupyter serverextension enable --py ballet-submit-labextension
        # Install dependencies
        jlpm
        # Build Typescript source
        jlpm build
        # Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
        jupyter labextension link .
        
        # Rebuild Typescript source after making changes
        jlpm build
        # Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
        jupyter lab build
        ```
        
        You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.
        
        ```bash
        # Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
        jlpm watch
        # Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab
        jupyter lab --watch
        ```
        
        ### Uninstall
        
        ```bash
        pip uninstall ballet-submit-labextension
        jupyter labextension uninstall jupyterlab_ballet-submit-labextension
        ```
