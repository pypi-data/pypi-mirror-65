        This package contains a service: "@get_rss_feed" that is used as proxy to call an
        RSS feed from backend and not from frontend to avoid CORS problems.
        
        The service will reply with an "application/rss+xml" response with the desired feed.
        
        Each feed url has a 10 minutes cache for his result to avoid too much requests.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        You can call the endpoint passing a *feed* parameter like this example::
        
            > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/@get_rss_feed?feed=https://www.plone.org/RSS -H 'Accept: application/rss+xml'
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install redturtle.rssservice by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
