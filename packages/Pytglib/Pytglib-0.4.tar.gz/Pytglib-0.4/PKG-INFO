Description: # Python-Telegram
        
        > Welcome to Python-Telegram!
        > Python-Telegram is a python wrapper for tdlib, completely Object-Oriented and originally based on tdlib's suggested libs for python. 
        
        # Installation
        
        Installing the library is super easy. First, be sure to have Python3 installed in your server:
        `apt install python3`
        
        Then, simply execute the installation script:
        `python3 setup.py install` 
        
        And you're ready to go!
        
        # A simple script
        
        Here's a simple script that prints every update it receives from Telegram:
        
        ```
        from pytglib.client import Telegram
        
        # Change the values below
        api_id = 7
        api_hash = '123412341234123412341234'
        phone_number = '+12312312312'
        dbenc = '32_hexademical_chars'
        
        # Initiate the client
        client = Telegram(api_id=api_id, api_hash=api_hash, phone=phone_number, database_encryption_key=dbenc)
        
        # Login to the client
        client.login() 
        
        # Define the handler function
        def my_message_handler(update):
            print(update)
        
        # Register it
        client.add_message_handler(my_message_handler)
        
        tg.idle()
        
        # And you're ready to go!
        ```
        
        For more complex scripts, go to the Examples section below:
        
        # Documentation and examples
        
        The documentation is not complete at the moment, but you can see some examples in `examples` tree. Of course, we're doing our best to finish the documentation as soon as possible. 
        By the way, there's an auto generated documentation [here](https://pytelegram.readthedocs.io); It can help to find out about types and functions of the library.
