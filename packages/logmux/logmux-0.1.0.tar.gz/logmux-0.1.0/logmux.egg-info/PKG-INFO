Description: # logmux
        Logmux tails multiple log files, labels their lines and outputs everything in
        one stream - Much like docker-compose, but simply for local log files!
        
        # Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install logmux
        
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        ```bash
        logmux first.log second.log test/third.log
        
        ```
        
        This will tail all three log files. New lines will be prefixed with the name of
        the log file it came from, e.g. `first: ` for the first log file and `third: `
        for the last one.
        
        You can customize the labels by providing them as a query parameter for each
        file:
        
        ```bash
        logmux "first.log?label=custom" second.log test/third.log
        
        ```
        
        This will prefix all lines from the first file with `custom: `. You'll need to
        quote the argument like in this example to make sure that your shell is not
        going to split it.
        
        It's also possible to set the color of the label:
        
        ```bash
        logmux "first.log?label=custom&color=blue" "second.log?color=red" test/third.log
        
        ```

        In no particular order:
        
        * [MultiTail](https://www.vanheusden.com/multitail/) uses ncurses to tail multiple
          log files in one or more windows. Logmux takes a more simple approach by just
          printing to stdout.
