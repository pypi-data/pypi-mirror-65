0.2 (Apr 11, 2020) -- multi-utility

- Support for multi-instance data records (i.e. imaging data from multiple
  visits). Data is now organized into `instance-?/` subdirectories, where `?`
  is the instance ID (e.g. 2 or 3). In BIDS layout the same IDs are used as
  'session' identifiers. Data are now unconditionally grouped by
  instance/session, even if no multi-instance data is present yet, in order to
  improve forward-compatibility with future UKB updates.

- Availability of `ukbfetch` is now tested at the start of `ukb-update` to
  prevent a dirty crash during processing.

- Prevent crash of `ukb-init` with a different set of record IDs.

- Fix log setup to make user-targeted messages visible.

0.1 (Feb 13, 2020) -- don't touch this

- Initial draft implementation
