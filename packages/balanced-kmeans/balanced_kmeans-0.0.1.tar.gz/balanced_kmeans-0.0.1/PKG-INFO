Description: # Balanced K-Means clustering in PyTorch
        
        Balanced K-Means clustering in Pytorch with strong GPU acceleration.
        
        **Disclaimer:** This project is heavily inspired by the project [kmeans_pytorch](https://github.com/subhadarship/kmeans_pytorch). Each part of the original implementation is combined with the appropriate attribution.
        
        
        # Credits
        This implementation extends the package `kmeans_pytorch` which contains the
        implementation of the original Lloyd's K-means algorithm in Pytorch. You can check (and star!)
        the original package [here](https://github.com/subhadarship/kmeans_pytorch).
