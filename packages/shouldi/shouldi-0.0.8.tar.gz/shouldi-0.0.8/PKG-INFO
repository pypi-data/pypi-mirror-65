Description: # shouldi
        
        ![shouldi](https://github.com/intel/dffml/raw/master/examples/shouldi/shouldi.jpg)
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```console
        $ shouldi install insecure-package bandit
        bandit is okay to install
        Do not install insecure-package! {'safety_check_number_of_issues': 1}
        ```
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        `shouldi` depends on safety, pylint, and bandit being installed separately.
        
        ```console
        $ python3.7 -m pip install -U safety pylint bandit
        ```
        
        ## WTF is this
        
        `shouldi` is a tool that runs static analysis tools to let you know if there are
        any issues in any of the python packages you were thinking of installing.
        
        `shouldi` is similar to things like [Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/).
        
        Right now `shouldi` runs the following static analysis tools and complains if:
        
        - [safety](https://pyup.io/safety/)
        - [bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/)
        - [golangci_lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/blob/master/README.md)
        - [npm-audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit)

        #### What's This Really Called
        
        The real name of this package is "DFFML Evaluator for PyPi Packages". `shouldi`
        is mearly the command line invokation, and we claim `shouldi`, the package name
        on PyPi, to avoid a supply chain attack.
