l3py - L3 Products in Python
============================

What is l3py
------------

l3py is a free Open Source software package for computing mass anomalies from
time variable gravity field solutions. It is tailored for products of the GRACE
mission and its successor GRACE-FO.

The features of l3py are:

 * File I/O for common data formats including GFC files and COARDS compliant netCDF
 * Basic arithmetic operations for sets of potential coefficients
 * Propagation of spherical harmonic coefficients to gridded mass anomalies
 * Spatial filtering of potential coefficients
