Description: # An interactive wrapper for jq
        
        This can be used as part of a pipeline, or take a file as input.
        
        Use control-space to toggle compact mode; use control-R to toggle
        raw output.
        
        Use:
        
            somthing-that-produces-json | jqi
        
        or
        
            jqi /tmp/foo.json | file
        
        Use control-C to exit.
