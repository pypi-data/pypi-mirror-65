# PyPixie16

[![Docs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pypixie16/badge/?version=latest&style=plastic)](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pypixie16)

This module can be used to control, read, and analyze data from
Pixie16 modules from XIA [https://www.xia.com/DGF_Pixie-16.html] using python. To achieve this we provide
cytpes interface to the C-libraries provided by XIA. These libraries
need to be downloaded and installed from XIA-website for these python
modules to run.

We use a config.ini file to let the python file know where those
libraries can be found. If this file doesn't exist, the program will
prompt you with instructions on how to create one.

# Content

read.py: functions to read output file from the pixie using example program.
         Especially .bin files and .set files

analyze.py: calculate fast trigger and CFD from traces

control.py: control the pixie using python. This needs to be imported
            separately, e.g. "import pixie16.control" and it needs a
            32bit python, since all libraries are 32 bit.

variables.py: list of the variables in a settings file, including file position and number of values
              This can be recreated if needed from the included script create_variable_list.py.

# Documentation

Documentation is hosted on Read The Docs: https://readthedocs.org/projects/pypixie16/

# Known issues

We use revision F of the 500 MHz Pixie16 and the code has only been
tested for this module. It probably can be easily adapted for other
modules or even might work, but there is no garantee.

We also always use certain settings for some parameters and these
might also influence some of the analysis code (e.g. FastFilterRange).

# Tests

We should have a lot more of them ;)

Use 'python -m pytest' to run tests.

# Contribution

Pull requests are welcome.

We use black to format the code. Once you cloned the repo, please run

pip install pre-commit

and

pre-commit install
