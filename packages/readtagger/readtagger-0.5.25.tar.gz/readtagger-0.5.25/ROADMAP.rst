Plans and Ideas for continued development of readtagger
-------------------------------------------------------

-----------
v0.5
-----------
* Investigate if there is any advantage in reverse-complementing r2 reads for cap3 assembly
* Link Softclip clusters and insertios via event/mateid
* Annotate clusters where both ends of the insertions can be reach by mate pairs
* Simulate test-data module

-----------
v0.6
-----------
* Attempt to detect deletions or use deletion caller
