"""
A simple script that describes the main functionalities of the antimait library.
A gateway object is instantiated that listens for devices connected through serial ports;
the main way to customize its behaviour is by redefining its on_connect and attaching DataReceivers
through it.

The following example generates a plot for each device connected in the current working directory and
prints the data as it comes.
