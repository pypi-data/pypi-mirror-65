Description: # WTF-Backhoe
        
        Shovel rows of records from uploaded files to your app, using your existing forms for validation. Process the result as if you'd filled a hundred copies of the form by hand.
        
        Think of Backhoe as a powerful form-filling macro for WTForms.
        
        ## Status
        
        Nothing implemented. Plans in [design.md](design.md).
