# WTF-Backhoe

Shovel rows of records from uploaded files to your app, using your existing forms for validation. Process the result as if you'd filled a hundred copies of the form by hand.

Think of Backhoe as a powerful form-filling macro for WTForms.

## Status

Nothing implemented. Plans in [design.md](design.md).
