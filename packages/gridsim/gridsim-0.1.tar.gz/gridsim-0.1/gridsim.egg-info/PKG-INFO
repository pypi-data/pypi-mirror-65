Description: # Gridsim
        
        *Simple grid-based robot simulator*
        
        **[Documentation](https://gridsim.readthedocs.io/)**
        
        I'm planning on using this as a simple test-bed for my algorithms.
        
        This package will be a package/library for the simulator itself, not the robot code. This follows a similar structure (with a World, Robot, Logger, and Viewer) as Kilosim.
        
        I plan to package this with PyPi so I can easily use it with separate repositories for the algorithms.
        
        For reference on package structure, see the [package-boilerplate](https://github.com/jtebert/package-boilerplate).
