class HamiltonianObjective(VariationalObjective):
    """A variational objective associated with a Hamiltonian.

    The value of the objective is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian.
    The noise and cost model assume that one estimates the expectation value
    by measuring individual Pauli terms of the Hamiltonian a finite number
    of times. The resulting estimate is modeled as a random value drawn from
    a normal distribution centered at the true expectation value and whose
    variance is inversely proportional to the number of measurements taken.
    The cost corresponds to the number of measurements performed.

    Attributes:
        hamiltonian: The Hamiltonian of interest, represented
            as a FermionOperator, QubitOperator, InteractionOperator, or
            DiagonalCoulombHamiltonian. If the input is not a QubitOperator,
            then the Jordan-Wigner transform is used.
        variance_bound: The squared one-norm of the coefficients of
            the Pauli terms in the Jordan-Wigner transformed Hamiltonian.
            This gives an estimate of the variance of an energy measurement
            with a certain measurement strategy; see arXiv:1801.03524 for
            a derivation.
