    This class encapsulates the evaluation of an objective function. The
    objective function may be noisy. It is assumed that the objective function
    takes as input an array of real numbers. The dimension of the black box is
    defined to be the length of the input array.

    One can optionally provide a version of the objective function that takes a
    `cost` parameter. This is used to model situations in which the objective
    function is noisy but the amount of noise present can be controlled to some
    extent, i.e., providing a higher cost should reduce the magnitude of the
    noise.

    Attributes:
        dimension: The dimension of the array accepted by the objective
            function.
        bounds: Optional bounds on the inputs to the objective function. This is
            a list of tuples of the form (low, high), where low and high are
            lower and upper bounds on a parameter. The number of tuples
            should be equal to the dimension of the black box.
