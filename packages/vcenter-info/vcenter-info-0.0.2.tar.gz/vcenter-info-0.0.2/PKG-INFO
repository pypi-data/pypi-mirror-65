        ## Overview
        
        This project is used for making some simple
        queries to one or more vCenter host and rendering
        the results in a simple way, as a npm-managed React
        app with Flask.
        There's also a console script that outputs vm
        statistics in influx line protocol format.
         
        ## Package-based installation
        
        Create a (python 3) virtualenv and
        install using one of the following methods:
        
        ### From PyPi
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install vcenter-info
        ```
        
        ### From Source
        
        ```bash
        $ python setup.py sdist
        $ pip install dist/vcenter-info-x.y.z.tar.gz
        ```
        
        # Running
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Use `config-example.json` as a template to
        create a configuration file.
        When running the server an environment variable called
        `CONFIG_FILENAME` and containing the path to this
        configuration file must be present.
        
        ## Starting the Server
        
        ```bash
        CONFIG_FILENAME=config.json FLASK_APP=vcenter_info flask run
        ```
        
        Note: if you are running from a source distribution
        and didn't install it in your virtualenv, you should
        execute the above from the top-level folder.
        
        Alternatively, using the provided `app.py`
        might sometimes be convenient when developing:
        
        ```bash
        CONFIG_FILENAME=config.json python vcenter_info/app.py
        ```
        
        or:
        
        ```bash
        CONFIG_FILENAME=config.json python -m vcenter_info.app
        ```
        
        ## Running the Console Check
        
        ```bash
        Usage: check-vcenter-vms [OPTIONS]
        
        Options:
          --measurement TEXT  influx measurement name  [required]
          --config FILENAME   config filename  [required]
          --help              Show this message and exit.
        ```
        
        
        ## Development Environment
        
        These notes are for setting up a development environment.
        
        ### Setup
        
        Create a (python 3) virtualenv and install the requirements:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ... and, to install additional libraries used by the test scripts:
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Set up the node environment:
        
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
        
        ### Generate Javascript Bundle
        
        In a fresh environment, or whenever the ui
        sources are changed:
        
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
