Description: 
        Python wrapper around the M-Files API.
        
        Enables search, upload, download and creation of objects in M-Files vaults.
        When authentication is needed credentials are fetched from environment
        variables ``MFILES_USER`` and ``MFILES_PASS``. If they are not set the
        credentials are fetched from user input using ``input()`` and ``get_pass()``.
        To supply credentials programatically you can call the ``login()`` method with
        username and password before using the API, and all subsequent calls will be
        authenticated with the same token.
        
        M-Files property IDs for all object types are abstracted, so you can upload a
        ``Document`` using ``upload_file()`` with ``object_type="Document"`` and
        correct IDs will be fetched from the server.
