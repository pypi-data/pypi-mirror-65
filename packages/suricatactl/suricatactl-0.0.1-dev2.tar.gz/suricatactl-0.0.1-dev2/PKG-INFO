Description:  
        
        This package contains the Python support tools and libraries for
        Suricata useful for installing independently of Suricata.
        
        It is important to note that these tools are bundled and installed by
        Suricata, so you likely don't need to install this package, unless you
        need access to the libraries inside a virtualenv, or have a need to
        install them without installing Suricata.
