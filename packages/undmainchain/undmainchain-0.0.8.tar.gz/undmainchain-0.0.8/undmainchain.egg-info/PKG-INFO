        ## Revert
        
        To revert all data, fetch the latest binary, and uses the lastest published 
        genesis. Warning, this will destroy your chain data and catching up may take
        a while.
        
        ```
        python -m mainchain.upgrade revert
        ```

        ```

        ```
        
        The helper will wait until the specified block and then perform an upgrade.
