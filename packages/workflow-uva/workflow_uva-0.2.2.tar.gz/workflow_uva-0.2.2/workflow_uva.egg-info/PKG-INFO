Description: # Workflow
        
        # Workflow.json (Config file)
        A few things can or need to be added to `workflow.json`:
        * sequence, a list of assignments in order
          * For example: `"sequence": [
                "AssignmentWeek1",
                "AssignmentWeek2",
                "AssignmentWeek3"]`
        * groups, a dict of groups of assignments
          * It should be a dict with as key the name of a group. The value of this dict is again a dict, with keys "assignments" and "weight". The key "assignments" should have as value a list of assignments and "weight" should have the relative weight as a number (for the whole group).
          * For example: `"groups": {
                "Assignments": {
                    "assignments": [
                        "AssignmentWeek1",
                        "AssignmentWeek2",
                        "AssignmentWeek3",
                    ],
                    "weight": 20
                }}`
        * resits, a dict of resits, and which assignments it replaces
          * It should be a dict with as keys the names of the resits, and as values the name of the assignment it replaces or a list of names.
          * For example: `"resits": {
                "ResitExam1": "Exam1",
                "OverallResit": [
                    "Exam1",
                    "Exam2"
                ]
            }`
        * requirements, a list of minimal grades students have to have for assignment groups to pass the course
          * It should be a list of dictionaries, with as keys "groups" and "min_grade". The value of groups can be a string or list and should refer to the name of a group. The value of min_grade should be a number.
          * For example: `"requirements": [
                {
                    "groups": "Theoretical_Assignments",
                    "min_grade": 4.5
                },
                {
                    "groups": ["Practical_Assignments", "Theoretical_Assignments"],
                    "min_grade": 5.5
                }
            ]`
        
        
        # FAQ
        
        ## Where to get an Canvas API key?
        [See the Canvas API Documentation](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/file.oauth.html#manual-token-generation)
        
        ## Where to store the Canvas API key?
        The Workflow notebook will ask for it. Otherwise, it can be changed in the `workflow.json` file.
