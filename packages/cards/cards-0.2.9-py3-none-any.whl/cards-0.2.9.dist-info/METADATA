Project task tracking / todo list (in progress)

Initial Goals of the project
----------------------------

-   Create a command line application that can be used to track the
    status of a multi-person project.
-   Explore the problems inherent in all applications regarding
    usability, testing, packaging, deployment, etc.

Rough Current Status
--------------------

-   A \"usable\" API and CLI. The CLI workflow needs work.
-   Database location is flexible to the API, but the CLI hardcodes it
    to a single user home directory.

More info
---------

This is a demo application being built in conjunction with the [Test &
Code podcast](http://testandcode.com).

We\'ll be building up this application, and testing it, and adding
functionality, while discussing software testing and development
practices.

Follow along, starting with [episode 37](http://testandcode.com/37).
