color-matcher enables color transfer across images which comes in handy for automatic color-grading
of photographs, paintings, film sequences or light-fields. The methods behind the mappings are based on
histogram matching, the Monge-Kantorovich solution as proposed by Pitie et al. and
that of Reinhard.
