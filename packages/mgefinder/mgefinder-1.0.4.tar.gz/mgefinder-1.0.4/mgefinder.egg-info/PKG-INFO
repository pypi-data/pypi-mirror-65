        # *MGEfinder* - A toolbox for identifying mobile genetic element (MGE) insertions from short-read sequencing data of bacterial isolates.
        
        The command-line tool *MGEfinder* identifies large insertions and genotypes them with respect to a reference genome.
        
        It is designed to work with haploid genomes, and has been tested extensively on bacteria.
        
        It can identify mobile genetic elements and their sites of insertion using an *ab initio* approach.

        ## Special note on site-specific integrative mobile elements
        While *MGEfinder* can detect a wide variety of site-specific integrative mobile elements, it is best suited for transposable elements. For example, certain types of tRNA-targeting mobile elements will be missed by *MGEfinder* by default because of their unique integration mechanism, whereby they replace the target sequence with a new sequence to repair the tRNA. But *MGEfinder* can still find these integrative elements if you adjust the parameters properly. If you would like advice on how to do this, please open an [issue](https://github.com/bhattlab/MGEfinder/issues) with your request.
