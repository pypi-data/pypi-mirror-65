# Simple Quaternions (`squaternion`)

Generally I don't need all of the capabilities (or complexity) of `quaternion`
math libraries. Basically I just need a way to convert between Euler and
Quaternion representations and have a nice way to print them out.

## Install

  pip install squaternion

## Usage

This is all this library does, convert between Euler angles and Quaternions.
There are other libraries that do so much more ... but I don't need all of that.

```python
from squaternion import euler2quat, quat2euler, Quaternion

# if you know the values you want Quaternion(w, x, y, z), note this is a
# namedtuple so it is immutable once created
q = Quaternion(1,0,0,0)

# however you typically don't think in 4 dimensions, so create from
# euler angles euler2quat(roll, pitch, yaw), default is radians, but set
# degrees true if giving degrees
q = euler2quat(0, -90, 100, degrees=True)

# can get the euler angles back out in degrees (set to True)
e = quat2euler(*q, degrees=True)
```
