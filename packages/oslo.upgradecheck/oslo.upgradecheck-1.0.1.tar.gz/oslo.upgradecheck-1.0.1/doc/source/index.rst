Common code for writing OpenStack upgrade checks.

This project can be used to assist with the implementation of a
``$SERVICE-status`` command that responds to parameters of ``upgrade check``
by running upgrade check functions on the existing installation. For further
details see :doc:`usage` and the `Nova documentation on upgrade checks`_.
