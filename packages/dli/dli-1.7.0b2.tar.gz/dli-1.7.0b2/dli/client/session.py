    Entry point for the Data Lake SDK, returns a client instance that

    :param str api_key: Your API key, can be retrieved from your dashboard in
                        the Catalogue UI.
    :param str root_url: Optional. The environment you want to point to. By default it
                        points to Production.
    :param str host: Optional. Advanced usage, meant to force a hostname when DNS resolution
                     is not reacheable from the user's network.
                     This is meant to be used in conjunction with an
                     IP address as the root url.
                     Example: catalogue.datalake.ihsmarkit.com

    :param bool debug: Optional. Log SDK operations to a file in the current working
                       directory with the format "sdk-{end of api key}-{timestamp}.log"

    :param bool strict: Optional. When True, all exception messages and stack
                        trace are printed. When False, a shorter message is
                        printed and `None` should be returned.
