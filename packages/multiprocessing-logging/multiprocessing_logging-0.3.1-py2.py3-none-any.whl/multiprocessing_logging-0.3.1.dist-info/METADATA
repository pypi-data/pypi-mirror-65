When using the `multiprocessing` module, logging becomes less useful since
sub-processes should log to individual files/streams or there's the risk of
records becoming garbled.

This simple module implements a `Handler` that when set on the root
`Logger` will handle tunneling the records to the main process so that
they are handled correctly.

It's currently tested in Linux and Python 2.7 & 3.5+.

Pypy3 hangs on the tests so I don't recommend using it.

Pypy appears to be working, recently.

Only works on POSIX systems and only Linux is supported. It does not work on Windows.

# Origin

This library was taken verbatim from a [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/641420/how-should-i-log-while-using-multiprocessing-in-python)
and extracted into a module so that I wouldn't have to copy the code in every
project.

Later, several improvements have been contributed.

# Usage

Before you start logging but after you configure the logging framework (maybe with `logging.basicConfig(...)`), do the following:

```py
import multiprocessing_logging

multiprocessing_logging.install_mp_handler()
```

and that's it.

## With multiprocessing.Pool

When using a Pool, make sure `install_mp_handler` is called before the Pool is instantiated, for example:

```py
import logging
from multiprocessing import Pool
from multiprocessing_logging import install_mp_handler

logging.basicConfig(...)
install_mp_handler()
pool = Pool(...)
```
