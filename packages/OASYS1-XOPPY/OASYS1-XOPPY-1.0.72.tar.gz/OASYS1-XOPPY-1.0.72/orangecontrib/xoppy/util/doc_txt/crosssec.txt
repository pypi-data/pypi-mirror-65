==================================  CrossSec      =============================

 CrossSec is a widget based graphical interface to calculate Photon-Atom
 Cross Sections, Mass Absorption Coefficients and Liner Absorption Coefficients
 for elements, compounds and mixtures.
 The data are taken from the XRAYLIB data base:
 https://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib/wiki


 Possible calculations:
	Cross Section [barn/atom]
	Cross Section [cm^2]
	Mass Absorption Coefficient [cm^2/g]
	Linear Absorption Coefficient [cm^-1]

    3) Description of the input parameters
    ======================================


material: Select the desired material type. Three options are available:
	a) Element(formula) calculation for a single element.
	b) Mixture(formula) calculation for a compound or a mixture. The user
		defines the mixture formula.
		The syntax is the following: string with the chemical
		formula of the compound(s) with their weight fraction between
		parenthesis.
		Examples:
		H20
		SiO2(0.807)B2O3(0.129)Na2O(0.038)Al2O3(0.022)K2O(0.004)
		H2O(0.99)Cl2(0.01)
		H(0.11189834)O(0.88810166)
	c) Mixture(table) calculation for a compound or a mixture defined
		in the included mixture-table

table: Compound table, only available if the c) option in material is chosen.

formula: The element or compound or mixture formula, depending the "material"
		selection.

calculate: type the calculation magnitude.

Energy [eV] grid: the abscissas values for the calculations. Two
		options are available:
		a) Standard
		b) User-defined, with the parameters described below.
		c) Single-value, with the energy to be entered in
		   "Starting Energy [eV]" box.

Stating Energy [eV]: the initial energy value (only available if either
		b) or c) is chosen in the "Energy [eV] grid" entry.

To: the last energy value (only available if b) is chosen in the
		"Energy [eV] grid" entry.

Number of points: the number of energy points (only available if b) is
		chosen in the "sin_theta/lambda grid" entry.

Units: the units in which the Cross Sections are presented
