Description: pygments-lexer-solidity
        =======================
        
        Solidity lexer for Pygments, distributed as a PyPI package.
        
        If you want pretty syntax highlighting in documentation for Solidity
        files, and you're using Pygments, this might just be the thing for you.
        
        Currently, Solidity keywords up to version 0.6.0 are included, to the
        best of my ability. MRs are welcome!
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pip install pygments-lexer-solidity``
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Depends on doc-building infrastructure.
        
        Sphinx
        ^^^^^^
        
        Have this in Sphinx's ``conf.py``:
        
        .. code-block:: python
           
           from sphinx.highlighting import lexers
           from pygments_lexer_solidity import SolidityLexer
           lexers['solidity'] = SolidityLexer()
        
        Then use ``.. code-block:: solidity`` for Solidity code blocks.
        
        Command-line
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        If you just want to test a local copy of the lexer on the CLI:
        
        .. code-block:: shell
           
           % pygmentize -x -l pygments_lexer_solidity/lexer.py:SolidityLexer example.sol
