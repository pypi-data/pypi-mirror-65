        Wagtail Links
        =============
        
        Purpose
        =======
        
        Wagtail links has two goals:
        
        - Provide a consistent way to refer to links, which may be of different types, so as to reduce decision fatigue
        - Minimize broken links as much as possible.
        
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        Install wagtail-links via Pip.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            pip install wagtail-links
        
        Add ``wagtail_links`` to your Django project's INSTALLED_APPS setting.
        
        Run database migrations.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            python manage.py migrate
        
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Add a foreign key to the page you wish to add links to.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            my_link = models.ForeignKey(
                'wagtail_links.Link',
                null=True,
                blank=True,
                on_delete=models.SET_NULL,
                related_name='+'
            )
        
        Neat:
        
        .. image:: admin.png
        
        You may use it like:
        
        .. code:: html
        
            <a href="{{ self.link.url }}">Link here</a>
        
        
        From a template, you can also load a link by its name:
        
        .. code:: html
        
            {% load get_wagtail_link_url from wagtail_links %}
        
            <a href="{% get_wagtail_link_url 'my-link' %}">Link here</a>
        
        This is useful for global page links, navigation, etc.
        
        
        
        Validation and logging
        ======================
        
        The Link model will validate that one and only one field is set.
        It will also disallow invalid Django reverse view names.
        
        If a URL cannot be determined, we'll log the issue as a warning. We won't throw an exception as that would be bad for users. You are responsible for capturing this log warning, perhaps using Sentry.
        
        For example - let's say you make a Django view name called admin:index. This would typically give you `/admin/`. Later the admin application is removed from the program, now this link fails. It will now display "" and generate a warning in your server logs.
