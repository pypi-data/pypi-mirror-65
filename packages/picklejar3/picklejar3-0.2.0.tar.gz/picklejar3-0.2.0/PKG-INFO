# PickleJar3

**Do not use, under development**

Something I wrote a while ago for storing data. I want to flush it out into
something better.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
from picklejar3.picklejar import PickleJar


pj = PickleJar()
pj.init("bob.pickle", 3)

for i in range(9):
    pj.push("a", i)

pj.push("b", 3.33)
pj.push("d", -1200)

pj.close()

pj.read("bob.pickle")
print(pj.buffer)
```
