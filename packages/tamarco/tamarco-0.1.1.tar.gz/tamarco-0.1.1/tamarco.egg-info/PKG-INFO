        Microservices framework designed for asyncio and Python.
        
        ## Features
        
        * Lifecycle management.
        * Standardized settings via etcd.
        * Automatic logging configuration. Support for sending logs to an ELK stack.
        * Application metrics via Prometheus. 
        * Designed for asyncio.
        * Messaging patterns. The framework comes with support for AMQP and Kafka via external resources. The AMQP resource has 
        implemented publish/subscribe, request/response and push/pull patterns. 
        * Custom encoders and decoders. 
        * Pluging oriented architecture. Anyone can create a new resource to add new functionality. External resources are integrated 
        into the framework transparently for the user.
        * Graceful shutdown.
        
        ## Resources
        
        The framework allows to write external resources and integrate them in the lifecycle of a microservice easily. List with
         the available resources:
        
        * Metrics
        * Registry
        * Status
        * Profiler
        * Memory analizer
        * HTTP
        * [Kafka][kafka_resource]
        * [AMQP][amqp_resource]
        * Postgres (not released yet)
        * Influxdb (not released yet)
        * Redis (not released yet)
        * Websocket (not released yet)

        ## Examples
        
        There are several examples in the `examples` folder.
        
        To run them, install tamarco, launch the docker-compose (not necessary for all the examples) and run it.
        
        ```python3
        pip install tamarco
        docker-compose up -d
        python examples/http_resource/microservice.py
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Support for Python >= 3.6.
