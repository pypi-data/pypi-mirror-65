        Out of this world beautiful plots with dark mode for earth!
        
        Dark mode saves power. Saving power keeps more fossil fuels in the ground.  More fossil fuels in the ground means we are saving earth.
        
        ## usage
        
        
        ## notes for devs:
        *.gitignore** will only effect files that haven't been 'added' already.
        
        To make new .gitignore entries affect all files 
        
         1. Make changes to .gitignore
         2. `git commit -a -m "Pre .gitignore changes"`
         3. `git rm -r --cached .`
         4. `git add .`
         5. `git commit -a -m "Post .gitignore changes"`
         6. `git status`
         should output "nothing to commit (working directory clean)"
        `# this is the readme!
        
        package your wheel: `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
