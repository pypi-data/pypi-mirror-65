Description: 
        # pyBESS
        
        `pybess` is a Python library which lets you interact with BESS using gRPC.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install the library directly using pip/pip3:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install "git+https://github.com/rvichery/bess.git@pybess-python
        -package#egg=pybess&subdirectory=pybess"
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        As mentioned above `pybess` can be used to communicate with BESS over gRPC. 
        
        An example of usage of this library is to list all BESS ports remotely:
        ```python
        import sys
        
        from google.protobuf.json_format import MessageToDict
        from pybess.bess import BESS
        
        bess = BESS()
        try:
            bess.connect(grpc_url="%s:10514" % sys.argv[1])
            ports = bess.list_ports()
            print(MessageToDict(ports)["ports"])
        finally:
            bess.disconnect()
        ```
