        a mapping of destination-annotation-keys --> source-locals-keys;
        if a `source` is callable, the value to salvage is retrieved
        by calling ``value(locs)``.
        They take precedence over`salvage_vars`.

    :raises:
        any exception raised by the wrapped function, annotated with values
        assigned as attributes on this context-manager

    - Any attributes attached on this manager are attached as a new dict on
      the raised exception as new  ``jetsam`` attribute with a dict as value.
    - If the exception is already annotated, any new items are inserted,
      but existing ones are preserved.

    **Example:**

    Call it with managed-block's ``locals()`` and tell which of them to salvage
    in case of errors::


        try:
            a = 1
            b = 2
            raise Exception()
        exception Exception as ex:
            jetsam(ex, locals(), "a", b="salvaged_b", c_var="c")
            raise

        import sys
        sys.last_value.jetsam
        {'a': 1, 'salvaged_b': 2, "c_var": None}

    ** Reason:**

    Graphs may become arbitrary deep.  Debugging such graphs is notoriously hard.

    The purpose is not to require a debugger-session to inspect the root-causes
    (without precluding one).

    Naively salvaging values with a simple try/except block around each function,
    blocks the debugger from landing on the real cause of the error - it would
    land on that block;  and that could be many nested levels above it.
