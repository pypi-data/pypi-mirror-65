Description: Python MANO Wrappers
        =====================
        
        **Python MANO Wrappers (PMW)** is a python wrapper around the REST API
        calls of various MANOs. It is also a standardisation effort to 
        unify the REST API of various MANOs by enforcing the ETSI SOL005 standard 
        on API calls. This project is developed as part of the project group SCrAMbLE
        at the University of Paderborn for the 5G-PICTURE project.  
        
        Documentation is available here - `ReadtheDocs <https://python-mano-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/adaptor/>`_.
        
        **Example usage:**
        
        .. code-block:: bash
            
            import wrappers
        
            username = "admin"
            password = "admin"
            mano = "osm"
            # mano = "sonata"
            host = "manosonatademo.com"
        
            if mano == "osm":
                _client = wrappers.OSMClient.Auth(host)
            elif mano == "sonata":
                _client = wrappers.SONATAClient.Auth(host)
        
            response = _client.auth(
                        username=username, password=password)
        
            print(response)
