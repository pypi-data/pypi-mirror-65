The program `cavcalc` is a convenient tool for computing parameters associated
with Fabry-Perot style optical cavities. The recommended way to use
cavcalc is to invoke it via the command line, however a Python API
is also exposed such that it can be used in the same way as any other
Python module.

Installation is simple, just run::

    pip install --upgrade cavcalc

to install the latest release version of cavcalc.
