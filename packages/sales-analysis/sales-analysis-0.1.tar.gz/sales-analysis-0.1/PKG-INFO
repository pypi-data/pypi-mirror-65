        ## How to run the app
        
        After successfully installing `sales_analysis`. The app may be run without any modification to `sales_analysis/data_pipeline/data`. However, this will execute the sample data provided. In order to change the default behaviour, the data in `sales_analysis/data_pipeline/data` must be replaced with new data. **Note: It is imperative that this folder contains data formatted in the same way as provided**. 
        
        Once the data has been imported, then follow the steps below.
        
        1. Open a terminal and enter `python` to launch an interactive python session.
        ```
        > python
        Python 3.7.7 (default, Mar 23 2020, 16:19:08) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>>
        ```
        
        2. Then enter the following
        ```
        >>> from sales_analysis import sales_app
        >>> app.run()
        ```
        
        This will output the following.
        
        ```
        * Serving Flask app "sales_analysis" (lazy loading)
        * Environment: production
          WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
          Use a production WSGI server instead.
        * Debug mode: off
        * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
        ```
        
        3. Then copy and paste `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` into a browser. The default page will return the message below
        
        > ## Not Found
        
        The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.
        
        4. Add a valid date to the url. For example, add `2019-08-02` to the url i.e. `http://127.0.0.1:5000/2019-08-02`. This will output the following in the browser.
        
        ```python 
        {"customers":10.0,
         "discount_rate_avg":0.12950211356271726,
         "items":3082.0,
         "order_total_avg":1341449.559055637,
         "total_discount_amount":20061245.64408109}
        ```
        
        If an incorrectly formatted date is passed, the server will raise an error. For example, if `2019-08` is passed, the following error is raised.
        
        ```
        ValueError: time data '2019-08' does not match format '%Y-%m-%d'
        ```
