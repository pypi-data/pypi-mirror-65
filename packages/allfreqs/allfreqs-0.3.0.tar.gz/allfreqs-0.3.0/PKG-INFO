        Features
        ========
        
        Calculate allele frequencies from a nucleotide multialignment in fasta or csv format.
        
        Allele frequencies will be returned as a table in which each row is a nucleotide position (based on
        the provided reference sequence) and columns are A, C, G, T frequencies as well as gaps and other
        non-canonical nucleotides.
        
        For example, given the following multialignment:
        
        +------+----------+
        | ID   | Sequence |
        +======+==========+
        | ref  | ACGTACGT |
        +------+----------+
        | seq1 | A-GTAGGN |
        +------+----------+
        | seq2 | ACCAGCGT |
        +------+----------+
        
        the resulting allele frequencies will be:
        
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | position | A   | C   | G   | T   | gap | oth |
        +==========+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+
        | 1.0_A    | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | 2.0_C    | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 |
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | 3.0_G    | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | 4.0_T    | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | 5.0_A    | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | 6.0_C    | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | 7.0_G    | 0.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        | 8.0_T    | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.5 |
        +----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
        
        Frequencies of non-canonical (ambiguous) nucleotides are by default squashed into the ``oth``
        column, but they can also be shown separately using a simple flag.
        
        allfreqs can be used either as a command line tool or through its Python API.
        
        For more information, please refer to the Usage_ section of the documentation.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        **PLEASE NOTE: allfreqs only supports Python >= 3.6!**
        
        The preferred installation method for allfreqs is using ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install allfreqs
        
        For more information, please refer to the Installation_ section of the documentation.
