# This allows 'coverage combine' to correlate the tracing data built while
# running tests in multiple tox virtualenvs. To take advantage of this
# properly, use "coverage erase" before tox, "coverage run --parallel-mode"
# inside tox to avoid overwriting the output data (by writing it into
# .coverage-XYZ instead of just .coverage), and run "coverage combine"
# afterwards.
