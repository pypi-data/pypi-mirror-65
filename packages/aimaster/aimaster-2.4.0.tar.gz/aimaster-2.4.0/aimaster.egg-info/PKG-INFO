Description: aimaster
        ========
        
        Artificial Neural Network learning and experimentation tools with live visualization.  
        (NOTE: Donot use visualization with large networks :) as it has memory constraints.)  
          
        This module needs numpy and scipy installed.  
        
        Feel free to experiment with aimaster.
