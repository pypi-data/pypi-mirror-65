Description: 
        # mpymodcore - a micro framework for MicroPython
        
        an approach to modularize MicroPython projects.
        
        introduce a defined lifecycle and eventing model
        for modules / devices for convenient handling
        of loose coupled modules/ device

        # Simple Web Server included
        
        In package `modext.webserv` there are some functions for request handling.
        
        In package `modext.webserv.serve` there is an example web server included.
        Sample code in
        [`serve.py`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/modext/webserv/serve.py)
        
        Support for body data decoding e.g. form data, json
        
        
        # Related project
        
        `mpymodcore` is the successor of [mpyconfigbase](https://github.com/kr-g/mpyconfigbase)
        
        for configuration of automatic startup of WLAN, SoftAP, and WebRepl refer to the 
        source/ sample code also there
        
        
        # Platform
        
        Tested ESP32 with PSRam and ESP8266 (for latter, see limitations below)
        
        ## Development status
        
        Alpha state.
        The API or logical call flow might change without prior notice.
        
        In case your code breaks between two versions check
        [`CHANGELOG`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/CHANGELOG.MD)
        information first before creating a ticket / issue on github. thanks.
        
        
        # Limitations
        
        - no asyncio integration as of now 
        - with all mod's enabled as shown here in the sample
         it will not run on ESP8266 due to memory limit.
         but wlan, softap, and ntp should work 
        
        # Installation
        
        - with pip
        
            `# install to the current (project) folder`
            
            `python3 -m pip install mpymodcore --target .` 
            
         
        - with [pygitgrab](https://github.com/kr-g/pygitgrab)
         to sync the master branch to your project folder 
         download the `mpymodcore.pygg` file from the repo to your local project folder
         and download the sources then with:
        
            `python3 -m pygitgrab -f mpymodcore.pygg`
         
        
        # Sample Code
        
        some sample code can be found in [`boot.py`](https://github.com/kr-g/mpymodcore/blob/master/boot.py)
