Description: quick and dirty lib for submitting jobs to slurm via python2/python3.
        
        ```Python
        from slurmpy import Slurm
        
        s = Slurm("job-name", {"account": "my-account", "partition": "my-parition"})
        s.run("""
        do
        lots
        of
        stuff
        """)
        
        ```
        
        The above will submit the job to `sbatch` automatically write the script to `scripts/`
        and automatically write logs/{name}.err and logs/{name}.out. It will have today's
        date in the log and script names.
        
        The script to run() can also contain `$variables` which are filled with the cmd_kwarg dict.
        E.g. `echo $name` could be filled with `cmd_kwargs={'name': 'sally'}`
        
        A command can be tested (not sent to queue) by setting the `_cmd` are to `run` as e.g. "ls".
        The default is `sbatch` which submits jobs to slurm.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        Each time `slurmpy.Slurm().run()` is called, it returns the job-id of the submitted job. This
        can then be sent to a subsequent job:
        ```
        s = Slurm()
        s.run(..., depends_on=[job_id])
        
        ```
        to indicate that this job should not run until the the job with `job_id` has finished successfully.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        ```Shell
        pip install slurmpy --user
        ```
