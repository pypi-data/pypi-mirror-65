        .. Rationale
        .. =========
        .. There are a lot of projects that need a cryptocurrency payment system under
        .. the hood for transactions sending/receiving, unique addresses creation, fee
        .. estimating and other blockchain interactions. Each of them have to implement
        .. their own service for that propose due to lack of opensource product, that
        .. could satisfy their needs. This project aims to provide such functionality and
        .. facilitate the implementation of such a microservice.
