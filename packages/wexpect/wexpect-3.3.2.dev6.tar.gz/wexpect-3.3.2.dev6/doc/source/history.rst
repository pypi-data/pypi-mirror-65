History
=======

Wexpect was a one-file code developed at University of Washington. There were several
`copy <https://gist.github.com/anthonyeden/8488763>`_ and
`reference <https://mediarealm.com.au/articles/python-pexpect-windows-wexpect/>`_
to this code with very few (almost none) documentation nor integration.

This project fixes these limitations, with example codes and pypi integration.
