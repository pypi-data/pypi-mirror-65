Description: # A Visualizer for Makefiles
        
        ## DESCRIPTION
        
        `makefile2dot` produces a Graphviz `dot` graph from a Makefile. To run it,
        install `graphviz` and `python`. This version runs on python 3.
        
        ```bash
            sudo apt-get install graphviz python
        ```
        
        ## USAGE
        
        `makefile2dot` writes to `stdout` by default, which can be read in by
        `graphviz`. So the nice trick is to pipe output from `makefile2dot` directly in
        to `dot`. The `Makefile` is read from `stdin` to support piping input as well.
        
        Example usage:
        
        ````bash
            makefile2dot <Makefile | dot -Tpng > out.png
        ````
        
        ## Tips
        
        To test this project in the source directoy, add the source directory to the
        python path:
        
        ````bash
        $ export PYTHONPATH=.
        ````
