Description: MATHEMATICAL DISTRIBUTION ANALYSER
        --------------------------------------
        Analyse distributions inlcuding their mean, standard deviation and plots. The below distributions can be analysed in this package:
        * Binomial distribution
        * Gassian distribution
        * General distribution
        
        
        Installation
        ----------------------
        Run the following code in your terminal
        `pip install deoga_distribtions`
        
        
        Understanding the package
        ---------------------------
        `Generaldistribution.py` - Initiates distribution class and contains the formulas(`mu`,`sigma`) for general distributions and reads file data using the `read_data_file` method.  
        `Gaussiandistribution.py`  - Inherits distribution class and contains the following methods   
        * `calculate_mean` - Calculate the mean of a Gaussian distribution
        * `calculate_stdev` - Calculate the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution  
        * `plot_histogram` - Plot the Gaussian distribution.   
        * `pdf` - Calculate the probablility density function of the Gaussian distribution.  
        * `plot_histogram_pdf` - Plot a histogram of the probability density function of the gaussian distribution.  
        * `__add__` - Add two Gaussians together.   
        * `__repr__` - Print characteristics of Gaussian distribution    
        `Binomialdistribution.py`  - Inherits distribution class and contains the following methods:  
        * `calculate_mean` - Calculate the mean of a Binomial distribution.  
        * `calculate_stdev` - Calculate the standard deviation of a Binomial distribution.  
        * `replace_stats_with_data` - replace hardcoded statistics with binomial data.  
        * `plot_bar` - Plot bar graph of the Binomial distribution.  
        * `pdf` - Calculate the probablility density function of the Binomial distribution.  
        * `plot_bar_pdf` - Plot a bar of the probability density function of the Binomail distribution.  
        * `__add__` - Add two Binomials together.  
        * `__repr__` - Print characteristics of Binomial distribution.  
        
        
        
        
        Usage
        -----------------------
        
        Run scripts in a python compiler.  
        
        Quick Tests
        -----------------------
        Some tests to check if package is working is to run the following in a python code executer:   
        `from deoga_distributions import Gaussian, Binomial`  
        `Gaussian(10, 7)`  
        `Binomial(0.4, 16)`
        
        You should get a returned string describing the distribution characteristics with no errors.
        
        
        Extending this
        -------------------------
        
        If you want to extend this work, here are a few places to start:
        
        * Add new models to the distribution
        * Add new plots to the models
        * Add new statisticals analytical methods to the distributions
