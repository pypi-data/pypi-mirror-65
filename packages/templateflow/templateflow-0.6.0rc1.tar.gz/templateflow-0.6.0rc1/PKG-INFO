Description: Group inference and reporting of neuroimaging studies require that individual's
        features are spatially aligned into a common frame where their location can be
        called standard.
        To that end, a multiplicity of brain templates with anatomical annotations
        (i.e., atlases) have been published.
        However, a centralized resource that allows programmatic access to templates is
        lacking.
        TemplateFlow is a modular, version-controlled resource that allows researchers
        to use templates "off-the-shelf" and share new ones.
