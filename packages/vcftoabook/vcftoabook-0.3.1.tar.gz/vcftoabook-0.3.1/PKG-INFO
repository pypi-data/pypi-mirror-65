Description: # VCF to addressbook
        
        A python script for converting .vcf contact files into abook files to be used in the addressbook program for Mutt/Neomutt
        
        **Note:** This project is in the Alpha stage. Help with testing on various distros/vcf versions would be appreciated
        
        ## Requirements
        * Python 3.6+
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run `pip install --user vcftoabook`
        
        ## Usage
        
        Simply run `vcftoabook file.vcf` to generate an addressbook file. Vcftoabook also works on directories and will parse all the .vcf files in a given directory and output one addressbook file. You may also specify an output file/path with `vcftoabook file.vcf -o <path>/<filename>`. Run `vcftoabook -h` for help.
        
        ## Testing
        Currently tested with:
        * Arch Linux
        * Nextcloud 16.x VCF version 4
        
        ## TODO
        - [x] Refactor into a proper command line application
        - [x] Test with multiple vcf versions.
        - [x] Ability to add directory of vcf files
        - [ ] Ability to update existing addressbook with new contacts/emails
        - [ ] vdirsyncer/caldav support(?)
        - [-] Build deployment packages
          - [ ] AUR
          - [x] Pypi
