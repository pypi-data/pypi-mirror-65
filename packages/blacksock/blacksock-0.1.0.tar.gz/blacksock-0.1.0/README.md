# Black Sock Cammidi

Black Sock is a simple OpenCV application that turns your webcam into a MIDI (most likely foot) controller.

You just select a webcam, choose wherever your controller "buttons" should be and wear black socks! The button will be pressed when your foot enters the defined area.

**WARNING:** Black Sock is under heavy development, and everything is likely to be changed. Everywhere be dragons!

See the tutorial in the `docs` folder, or press `h` when the application is running for a detailed tutorial.

## Installation & Running

There is no package yet. Just run
```
