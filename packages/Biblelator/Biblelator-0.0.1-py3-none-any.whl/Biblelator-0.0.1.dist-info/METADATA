A USFM Bible editor using the BibleOrgSys library and
Python's tKinter windowing library for simple and easy installation.

NOTE: This packaging is still being tested following massive restructuring,
and is not necessarily fully functional until it is marked as v0.1.0 or higher.
We also have hopes to improve documentation before v0.2.0.

After that point, we also hope to release Docker and Snap versions.

This software has been developed in small chunks of spare time since 2013
(so it's not necessarily well-thought out, and definitely not polished).
However, it was used as my main Bible editor instead of Paratext
for a couple of years.

This package will not reach v1.0.0 until after the BibleOrgSys reaches it.

The API will not become fixed/stable until the v1.0.0 release.

No attempt at all has been made at memory or speed optimisations
and this is not planned until after the release of v1.0.0.

Biblelator is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu) but also runs on Windows (although not so well tested).
