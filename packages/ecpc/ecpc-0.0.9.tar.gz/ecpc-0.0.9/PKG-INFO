Description: # EcPc: Simple creation and managment of EC2 instances
        
        EcPc provides a small collection of command-line tools to launch, list,
        log in to, and terminate EC2 (spot) instances. 
        
        It's deliberately a basic
        tool with few parameters for a user to tweak.
        
        ## Prerequisites:
        
        You need to have an AWS account, and have you ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_ACCESS_KEYs to hand. Then install boto3 according to the 
        instructions [here](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/)
        
        ## Installation:
        
        Via `pip`:
        
        ```
        % pip install ecpc
        ```
        
        ## Usage:
        
        To launch an instance, use `ecpc create`:
        
        ```
        % ecpc create my_instance
        creating a t2.small instance in region eu-west-1 with ID my_instance
        key pair created
        security group created
        required ami identified
        launching instance - this may take some time...
        instance launched
        use 'ecpc list' to follow launch progress
        %
        ```
        
        You can change the instance type, and the region it is launched into:
        
        ```
        % ecpc create my_c5 -r us-west-1 -t c5.large
        creating a c5.large instance in region us-west-1 with ID my_c5
        key pair created
        security group created
        required ami identified
        launching instance - this may take some time...
        instance launched
        use 'ecpc list' to follow launch progress
        %
        ```
        
        To list your instances:
        
        ```
        % ecpc list
        ID            region     type      up_time   state       cost($)
        my_c5         us-west-1  c5.large  00:00:00  booting-up  0.00   
        my_instance   eu-west-1  t2.small  00:04:00  ready       0.00 
        ```
            
        **Note: the "cost" value is approximate**
        
        To log in to an instance, use `ecpc login`:
        
        ```
        % ecpc login my_instance

            See "man sudo_root" for details.
        
            ubuntu@my_instance:~$ 
        ```
        
        To transfer files and directories to/from your instance, use `ecpc transfer`:
        ```
        % ecpc transfer my_local_directory my_c5:./
        % ecpc transfer my_c5:./results/result.log . 
        ```
        
        To terminate an instance, use `ecpc terminate`:
        
        ```
        % ecpc terminate my_instance
        instance terminated
        security group deleted
        key pair deleted
        .pem file deleted
        %
        ```
        
        To create a new AMI based on the current state of an instance (e.g. after installation of a tailored software stack) use `ecpc save`:
        ```
        % ecpc save my_instance -n my_provisioned_ami
        AMI my_provisioned_ami-5867234 being created
        Please do not terminate my_instance for ten minutes.
        %
        ```
        Once ready, you can then launch a fresh instance based on this AMI:
        ```
        % ecpc create my_provisiooned_p2 -t p2.xlarge -_n my_provisioned_ami
        creating a p2.xlarge instance in region eu-west-1 with ID my_provisioned_p2
        key pair created
        security group created
        required ami identified
        launching instance - this may take some time...
        instance launched
        use 'ecpc list' to follow launch progress
        %
        ```
