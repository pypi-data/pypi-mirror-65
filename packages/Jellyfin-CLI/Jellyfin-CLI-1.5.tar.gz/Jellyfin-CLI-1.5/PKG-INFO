        ### How to install  
        This app requires Python3.6 or higher  
        You can install it by executing `pip3 install --user jellyfin-cli`  
        You will also need to install MPV. 
        I recommend symlinking the script to your path so you can execute it directly from the terminal:
        This will typically require something like the following:
        `ln -s $HOME/.local/bin/jellyfin-cli /usr/bin/jellyfin-cli`
        
        ### How to use
        The first time you run it, you will be greeted by a minimalist login prompt. This will repeat every time the token is invalidated.
        After that you can use the interface.
        ### Development
