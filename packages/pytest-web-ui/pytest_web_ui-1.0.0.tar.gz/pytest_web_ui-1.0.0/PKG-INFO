        [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)
        
        A web app for controlling PyTest interactively. With it, you can explore your
        test hierarchy (test packages/modules/classes/methods etc.), run tests at the
        click of a button and see the results presented in your web browser.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        - Run tests by group (module, class etc.) or individually.
        - Clear pass/fail labelling so you can dig down and find what failed quickly,
          instead of having to scroll up through many screens of terminal output.
        - Test files and dependencies are reloaded every time so you can run, tweak your
          code, then run again in a fast iteration cycle.
        - Runs on any modern OS (tested on Win10, macOS and Ubuntu)
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        - Requires Python3.6+ and pip.
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        Install and get started running your own PyTest tests:
        
        ```
        pip install pytest_web_ui
        pytest_web_ui /path/to/your/tests
        ```
        
        I recommend installing into an activated
        [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). You will
        want to make sure that all additional dependencies required to run your tests
        are installed into the same virtual environment.
        
        When you run with default options, the web app to browse and run tests should be
        opened automatically in your default browser. To view full docs for the 
        command-line parameters, run `pytest_web_ui --help`.
        
        Build from source
        =================
        
        Alternatively you may build from source. In addition to the prerequisites above,
        you must ensure you have installed [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
        and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/ryanc414/pytest_web_ui.git
        cd pytest_web_ui
        python build.py
        python test.py
        ```
        
        You may then install the local directory into an activated virual environment,
        along with other dependencies installed to run your tests:
        
        ```
        pip install .
        pytest_web_ui /path/to/your/tests
        ```
        
        Happy testing!
