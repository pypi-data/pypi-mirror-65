Description: # Airflow Kubernetes Pod Operator from Deployment
        
        Or `airkupofrod` for short, is a tiny package which does one thing - takes a deployment in your kubernetes cluster and 
        turns its pod template into a `KubernetesPodOperator` object.
        
        
        ## Installation and usage
        
        Ensure your airflow image has the python package `airkupofrod` installed
        
        ```bash
        pip install airkubofrod
        ```
        
        You will also need to make sure that a service account attached to your airflow pods
        has the a role capable of listing deployments bound to it. See [role-binding](./role-binding) for an example of this.
        
        This is in addition to the role bindings necessary for the `KubernetesPodOperator` to work which can be seen in the 
        [airflow helm chart](https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/airflow/templates/role.yaml) 
        
        ## Developing
        
        [Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) is used to test and develop inside kubernetes.
        
        After ensuring you have:
         * Skaffold
         * Helm
         * Some type of k8s cluster available
        
        Run:
        ```bash
        skaffold dev --force=false --cleanup=false --status-check=false-port-forward
        ```
        
        Then navigate to http://localhost:8080 and enable and trigger a run of the test deployments dag.
