Description: # simple-ocr library
        simpleocr is a python OCR package for traditional chinese based on deep learning method.
        
        The library consists of text localization and text recognition.
        
        ## text localization
        The model is the reimplementation of CRAFT(Character-Region Awareness For Text detection) by tensorflow.

        ## text recognition
        The reimplementation is based on CRNN model which RNN layer is replaced with self-attention layer.
